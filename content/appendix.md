# Interactive ultrafast electron scattering data exploration {#sec:appendix-software label="Appendix"}

The pursuit of science is accompanied by serious software development in most fields, often in the forms of instrument control, data acquisition, data analysis, and data presentation. One project spearheaded by the author, a graphical program for the interactive exploration of ultrafast electron scattering data (@fig:introduction-iris-screen), has had such a profound impact on the research within the Siwick research group that it deserves its own brief section.

## Streaming data reduction

Raw ultrafast electron scattering datasets can reach sizes hundreds of gigabytes. The data reduction operations such as averaging of equivalent scattering patterns is a slow process. Before the author joined the Siwick research group, it used to take multiple hours to finally look at scattering patterns following the end of an experiment.

To effectively reduce the data, a streaming data reduction engine called `npstreams` was developed. `npstreams` extends the de-facto standard array processing library `numpy` to work on streams of arrays, that is, sequences of arrays that are not all available in memory at once. Such streams can be created, for example, by loading images one by one from disk; while thousands of images may need to be processed, only 10 or 20 of them might be loaded into memory at any moment. The advantage of streaming lies in the memory savings, which in turns results in much better performance. There are also many streaming algorithms are more performant than the algorithms used by `numpy`[@West1979].

The performance comparison between `npstreams` and `numpy` at averaging sequences of images is presented in @fig:introduction-npstreams-benchmark. In @fig:introduction-npstreams-benchmark a), fixed-length sequences of arrays of size $n \times n$ are averaged. This benchmark shows that the time-saving of using `npstreams` is correlated to the memory savings, as expected. @fig:introduction-npstreams-benchmark b), on the other hand, shows how much faster is `npstreams` at averaging variable-length streams of images with a fixed size. For reference, sequences of 100 -- 200 arrays of size $2048 \times 2048$ had to be averaged for the experiments shown in @sec:graphite and @sec:snse. As a final note, the low memory usage of `npstreams` also allowed to parallelize the averaging of images at different time-delays, which increased data reduction performance by a factor equal to the number of computer cores. Effectively, the data reduction step in the Siwick research group was improved from multiple hours down to less than 5 minutes.
