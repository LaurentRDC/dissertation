## Tin selenide

Single-crystal tin selenide at ambient pressure is found in two phases, both of which are layered[@Chattopadhyay1986]. The low-temperature $Pnma$ phase is defined on the following lattice vectors:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
    \vec{a}_1 \\
    \vec{a}_2 \\
    \vec{a}_3
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
    \SI{11.42}{\angstrom} & 0                    & 0 \\
    0                     & \SI{4.19}{\angstrom} & 0 \\
    0                     &  0                   & \SI{4.46}{\angstrom} 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
    \vec{e}_1 \\
    \vec{e}_2 \\
    \vec{e}_3
\end{pmatrix}
$$
where $\set{ \vec{e}_i }$ are understood to be the usual Euclidean vectors. The atomic positions are for the $Pnma$ phase are:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
    \vec{\text{Se}}_1 \\
    \vec{\text{Se}}_2 \\
    \vec{\text{Se}}_3 \\
    \vec{\text{Se}}_4 \\
    \vec{\text{Sn}}_1 \\
    \vec{\text{Sn}}_2 \\
    \vec{\text{Sn}}_3 \\
    \vec{\text{Sn}}_4 
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
    0.14 & \sfrac{3}{4} & 0.52\\
    0.36 & \sfrac{1}{4} & 0.02\\
    0.64 & \sfrac{3}{4} & 0.98\\
    0.86 & \sfrac{1}{4} & 0.48\\
    0.12 & \sfrac{1}{4} & 0.09\\
    0.38 & \sfrac{3}{4} & 0.59\\
    0.62 & \sfrac{1}{4} & 0.41\\
    0.88 & \sfrac{3}{4} & 0.91
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
    \vec{a}_1 \\
    \vec{a}_2 \\
    \vec{a}_3
\end{pmatrix}
$$
The lattice vectors for the *conventional cell* of high-temperature phase, $Cmcm$, are given by:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
    \vec{a}_1 \\
    \vec{a}_2 \\
    \vec{a}_3
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
    \SI{11.71}{\angstrom} & 0                    & 0 \\
    0                     & \SI{4.31}{\angstrom} & 0 \\
    0                     &  0                   & \SI{4.32}{\angstrom} 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
    \vec{e}_1 \\
    \vec{e}_2 \\
    \vec{e}_3
\end{pmatrix}
$$
and the following atomic positions:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
    \vec{\text{Se}}_1 \\
    \vec{\text{Se}}_2 \\
    \vec{\text{Se}}_3 \\
    \vec{\text{Se}}_4 \\
    \vec{\text{Sn}}_1 \\
    \vec{\text{Sn}}_2 \\
    \vec{\text{Sn}}_3 \\
    \vec{\text{Sn}}_4 
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
    0.14 & \sfrac{1}{2}  & \sfrac{3}{4}\\
    0.36 & 0             & \sfrac{1}{4}\\
    0.64 & 0             & \sfrac{3}{4}\\
    0.86 & \sfrac{1}{2}  & \sfrac{1}{4}\\
    0.12 & 0             & \sfrac{1}{4}\\
    0.88 & 0             & \sfrac{3}{4}\\
    0.38 & \sfrac{1}{2}  & \sfrac{3}{4}\\
    0.62 & \sfrac{1}{2}  & \sfrac{1}{4}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
    \vec{a}_1 \\
    \vec{a}_2 \\
    \vec{a}_3
\end{pmatrix}
$$
The primitive cell for the $Pnma$ phase is twice the size of the primitice cell for the $Cmcm$ phase.

### Lattice instability

## Experimental methods

### Sample preparation

Sample preparation involves two steps. Bulk crystals of SnSe were first synthesized, followed by processed by which ultrathin samples were produced.

Bulk SnSe crystals (\SI{20}{\gram}) were synthesized by mixing appropriate ratios of high purity starting materials (Sn chunk, 99.999\%, American Elements, USA and Se shot, 99.999\%, 5N Plus, Canada) in \SI{13}{\milli\meter} diameter quartz tube. The tube was flame-sealed at a residual pressure of $\SI{1e-4}{\mmHg}$, then slowly heated to \SI{1223}{\kelvin} over \SI{10}{\hour}, soaked at this temperature for 6h and subsequently furnace cooled to room temperature. The obtained ingot was crushed into powder and flame-sealed in a quartz tube, which was placed into another, bigger, flame-sealed quartz tube. A crystal with dimensions of $\sim$\SI{13}{\milli\meter} (diameter) $\times$ \SI{20}{\milli\meter} (length) was obtained.

In order to obtain ultrathin samples suitable for ultrafast electron scattering experiments, two methods were tried. Ultramicrotomy yielded suitable samples, but the author wanted to rule out the effect of strain induced by the sample preparation. To this end, a sample was also prepared via mechanical exfoliation.

#### Ultramicrotomy

Six samples were prepared via ultramicrotomy, a sample preparation technique which involves the cutting of samples using a diamond blade. While this technique has mostly been used to prepare organic samples for cryo-electron microscopy, it has been successfully used in the past decade to prepare samples of two-dimensional materials such as 4H-TaSe$_2$[@Erasmus2012], 1T-TaS$_2$[@Eichberger2013]. The author initially tried ultramicrotomy to prepare samples of 1T-TiSe$_2$[@Otto2020].

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-ultramicrotomy-femr file="figures/snse/ultramicrotome.py" caption="Ultramicrotome setup used to prepare SnSe samples, from two different angles. Crystals embedded in epoxy are mounted, and a diamond knife is used to shave a section. Sections slide down into a boat filled with water, where they are lated fished out. The images were provided by S. K. Sears from McGill University's Facility for Electron Microscopy Research."}
```

First, a bulk crystal of SnSe is embedded in epoxy, with the cutting plane parallel to the material layers. The surface of the bulk crystal is trimmed with a \ang{45} diamond blade to reveal fresh cutting surface. Sections are then cut with a sharper, \ang{35} diamond blade which then fall in a small water container. Floating sections are then fished out with a carbon-coated TEM grid. The assembly is shown in @fig:snse-ultramicrotomy-femr. The effect of cutting on the embedded crystals is shown in @fig:snse-ultramicrotomy.

The images were provided by H. Gnaegi from Diatome, Ltd."}
```

The samples used in this work were prepared by J. Mui from the Facility for Electron Microscopy Research (FEMR) at McGill University. In the end, six samples were produced: three with a thickness of \SI{70}{\nano\meter} and three with a thickness of \SI{90}{\nano\meter}, each with an area of approximately \SI{200 x 200}{\micro\meter}. 

#### Mechanical exfoliation

An ultrathin flake of SnSe was prepared via mechanical exfoliation, a procedure that is analogous to the work by Novoselov *et al*[@Novoselov2004]. A small chunk of SnSe was embedded in CrystalBond glue, on a standard \SI{3}{\milli\meter} copper TEM grid with a line spacing of 200 lines per inch. The embedded chunk was then exfoliated repeatedly using ordinary adhesive tape, until the embedded flake was translucent when observed with an optical microscope. The glue was washed away with acetone. This procedure resulted in a sample with an area of approximately \SI{50 x 50}{\micro\meter}.

The sample thickness was determined by taking the ratio of various reflections at thicknesses of \SI{70}{\nano\meter} and \SI{90}{\nano\meter} -- correcting for sample volume and electron flux -- and extrapolating to the intensity of the reflections in the exfoliated sample. Using this procedure, the thickness of the exfoliated sample was estimeted to be $\SI{30 \pm 5}{\nano\meter}$.

### Data acquisition

The experiments presented in this chapter used the same experimental geometry that is presented in @sec:experimental_setup. Ultrashort laser pulses of \SI{1.55}{\electronvolt} light were shone on the sample surface, with an incident angle of \ang{10}, at $t=t_0$, on SnSe samples oriented in the $[100]$ direction. To ensure that the samples had enough time to cool down after every laser shot, the repetition rate of experiments were varied from \SIrange{50}{1000}{\hertz}, but no changes were measured beyond the degradation of signal-to-noise. Therefore, a \SI{1000}{\hertz} repetition rate was used. 

Compressed electron bunches of $10^6$ electrons per bunch were transmitted through the sample at $t=t_0 + \tau$, where the time-delay $\tau$ was scanned from \SIrange{-10}{30}{\pico\second}. The total range of time-delay $\tau$ was limited compared to graphite (\SIrange{-40}{680}{\pico\second}) because the diffuse signals are much weaker in SnSe; limiting the total range of time-delay allowed for more averaging. The flagship measurement presented in this chapter was taken over \SI{72}{\hour}. This was only possible thanks to the advancements in laser-RF synchronization brought by work by the author in Otto *et al*[@Otto2017], which completely eliminated the drift in $t_0$ over the experiment duration.

The samples were photoexcited with a pump spot with a full-width at half-maximum that was at least twice the width of the sample, ensuring nearly-uniform illumination of the sample. The samples were photoexcited with photoexcitation densities ranging from \SIrange{6.6}{13.2}{\milli\joule\per\square\centi\meter}. The absorbed energy will be discussed further in this chapter. The scattering patterns were collected with a Gatan Ultrascan 895 camera, consisting of a 2.54 × 2.54 \si{\square\cm} phosphor screen fiber coupled to a 2048 px × 2048 px charge-coupled detector (CCD) placed \SI{29.39}{\centi\meter} away from the sample. Example static diffraction patterns are shown in 

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-diff-static file="figures/snse/diff-static.py" caption="Comparison of static diffraction patterns from samples prepared via two techniques. **a)** \SI{90}{\nano\meter}-thick sample prepared via ultramicrotome. **b)** \SI{30}{\nano\meter}-thick samples prepared via mechanical exfoliation."}
```

Contrary to the symmetrization procedure described in @sec:graphite-data-acquisition and shown in @fig:graphite-static, SnSe only has a two-fold symmetry in-plane. Therefore, the data presented in this chapter was *not* symmetrized.

## Ultrafast electron scattering measurements

### Effect of charge-transfer on diffracted intensity

### Evolution of Bragg peak profile

### Ultrafast phonon softening from Bragg intensity


The time-resolved suppression of Bragg intensity due to atomic vibrations is given by the following expression:
\begin{align}
    \frac{I_0(\vec{q},t) - I_0(\vec{q},0)}{I_0(\vec{q},0)} 
        &\equiv \Delta I_0(\vec{q},t) \nonumber \\
        &= \frac{N_c I_e |F|^2}{N_c I_e |F|^2}\frac{\left[e^{-2M(\vec{q},t)} - e^{-2M(\vec{q},0)}\right]}{e^{-2M(\vec{q},0)}} \nonumber \\
        &=e^{-2[M(\vec{q},t) - M(\vec{q},0)]} - 1
\end{align}
Rearranging terms:
$$
    - \frac{1}{2} \ln \left[1 + \Delta I_0(\vec{q},t) \right] = 2 \pi^2 |\vec{q}|^2 \Delta \langle u^2\rangle
$$
The change in root-mean-square vibration $\langle u^2(t)\rangle$ can be used to infer a change in vibrational frequency $\omega_{TO}(t)$ by considering the amount of energy stored in the mode $E_{TO}$, in the classical limit. Provided that the energy is conserved\cite{Kittel1976}:

\begin{align}
    E_{TO} &= 8 \pi^2 m \omega_{TO}^2(t) \langle u^2(t)\rangle \nonumber \\
           &= 8 \pi^2 m \omega_{TO}^2(0) \langle u^2(0)\rangle \nonumber
\end{align}

We can rearrange terms to use our experimental time-series for $\Delta \langle u^2\rangle$:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\omega_{TO}^2(0)}{\omega_{TO}^2(t)} =  \frac{ \Delta \langle u^2(t)\rangle}{ \langle u^2(0)\rangle} - 1
\end{equation}
