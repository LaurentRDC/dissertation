# On the origins of thermoelectricity in tin selenide {#sec:snse}

Ultrafast electron scattering is an ideal tool in the study of materials and systems in which charge carriers and the lattice do not behave in a concomitant manner. An example of such systems are charge-density wave materials like 1T-TaSe$_2$ and 1T-TiSe$_2$, where the electron density can morph into a periodic structure which might or might not be commensurate with the lattice periodicity. Thermoelectric materials are another class of systems where the charge carriers and the lattice are not on the same page. In such materials, a thermal gradient also generates an electrical current due to discrepancy between the electrical and thermal conductivities, the former being larger than the latter. 

Thermoelectric materials are of broad interest because can be used to harvest waste heat and transform this energy into useable electrical power [@Snyder2008; @Sootsman2009; @Zebarjadi2012]. The Perseverance rover, which has just landed at this time of writing these words, uses thermoelectrics to convert the heat generated by the natural radioactice decay of plutonium dioxide as a main power source [@Perseverance2021]. The combination of thermal and electrical properties that make a good thermoelectric material is not found in nature; efficient thermoelectrics must be engineered. It will be described later that the relevant parameters that can be controlled by materials scientist are all interdependent, which makes the optimization of thermoelectrics an arduous task.

Ultrafast methodologies in general have the ability to disentangle couplings between excitations by distinguishing relaxation time-scales. What may appear intrinsic at equilibrium might be revealed as a complex interplay in ultrafast measurements. And yet, ultrafast methodologies have rarely been applied to thermoelectric materials. This presents an opportunity to revolutionize the understanding of thermoelectrics which has only seen incremental progress in the past fifteen years.

In this chapter, the author seeks to understand one of the most performant thermoelectric materials, SnSe, and how to improve its thermoelectric efficiency even further near room temperature.

## The determinants of thermoelectric efficiency

The performance of a thermoelectric material is measured via the figure-of-merit $ZT$:
$$
    ZT = S^2 \frac{\sigma}{\kappa_e + \kappa_l}T
$$
where $S$ is the so-called Seebeck coefficient, $\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity, $\kappa_e$ and $\kappa_l$ are the thermal conductivities for the charge carriers and the lattice respectively, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. $ZT$ is an important figure of merit because it is used to describe the efficiency of a thermoelectric module. Consider a device with a cold side at temperature $T_C$, and a hot side at temperature $T_H$. The heat harvesting efficiency is given by:
$$
\eta = \frac{T_H - T_C}{T_H} \left( \frac{\sqrt{1 + ZT} - 1}{\sqrt{1 + ZT} + \frac{T_C}{T_H}} \right)
$$
where $\frac{T_H - T_C}{T_H}$ is understood to be the Carnot efficiency[@Zhang2014]. The value of $\eta$ for an abstract device is shown in @fig:snse-efficiency. This figure illustrates that good efficiency at reasonable temperatures ($<$\SI{450}{\kelvin}) requires a high $ZT$.

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-efficiency file="figures/snse/efficiency.py" caption="Efficiency of an abstract thermoelectric device harvesting energy from an interface at temperature $T_H$ and attached to a cold size at $T_C=\SI{300}{\kelvin}$."}
```

### The Seebeck coefficient

The Seebeck coefficient is a measure of how much voltage can be induced by a temperature gradient, usually expressed in units of \si{\micro\volt\per\kelvin}. It is negative (positive) for n-type (p-type) semiconductors. The Seebeck coefficient for a few elements are listed in @tbl:snse-seebeck-coefficients. Note that the Seebeck coefficient is highest for Selenium and Tellurium, while being vanishingly small for good conductors such as Gold and Platinum.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{Seebeck coefficients for a few selected elements. TODO: find citation}
	\vspace{2mm}
	\begin{tabular}{c | c}
		Element & Seebeck Coefficient [\si{\micro \volt \per \kelvin}] \\ \hline\hline
		Selenium  & 900 \\ \hline
        Tellurium & 500 \\ \hline
        Silicon   & 440 \\ \hline
        Gold      & 6.5 \\ \hline
        Platinum  & 0   \\ \hline
        Bismuth   & -72 \\ \hline
	\end{tabular} 
	\label{tbl:snse-seebeck-coefficients}
\end{table}

For a solid that is well-described by parabolic electronic bands, the Seebeck coefficient can be expressed as [@Rittner1959]:
$$
    S = - \frac{k_B}{e} \left( \frac{5 F_{3/2}(\bar{\mu})}{3 F_{1/2}(\bar{\mu})} - \bar{\mu}\right)
$$
where $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, $e$ is the quantum of charge, $\bar{\mu}=\mu/k_B T$ is the reduced chemical potential (relative to the edge of the conduction band), and $F_i$ is the Fermi-Dirac function defined as:
$$
    F_i(\bar{\mu})= \int_0^\infty dx \frac{x^i}{e^{x - \bar{\mu}} + 1}
$$
The Seebeck coefficient is largely determined by the value of the reduced chemical potential, and thus is mostly sensitive to doping [@Hicks1993a].

### Electrical conductivity

### Thermal conductivity

### Dimensionality reduction

In two seminal papers, Hicks and Dresselhaus [@Hicks1993a; @Hicks1993b] described the effects of dimensionality reduction on the thermoelectric figure of merit.

Due to the Wiedemann-Franz law, ...

## Tin selenide

Tin selenide (SnSe) is a layered mono-chalcogen which has attracted attention in the past few years because of its very high thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$, especially at high temperature, as reported by Zhao *et al.* [@Zhao2014; @Zhao2016a; @Zhao2016b]. While the exact value of this figure of merit is debated [@Wei2016], SnSe remains one of the most promising bulk thermoelectric materials[^zt-fully-dense]. The axis-projected $ZT$ based on the work by Zhao *et al.* [@Zhao2014] is shown in @fig:snse-zt. SnSe is interesting not only from a scientific standpoint but also from a practical one because, most importantly because it is lead-free (non-toxic) and composed of earth-abundant elements.

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-zt file="figures/snse/zt.py" caption="Thermoelectric figure-of-merit $ZT$ along the crystallographic axes of SnSe."}
```

SnSe's high thermoelectric efficiency is primarily due to an anomalously-low lattice thermal conductivity, especially in-plane. At room temperature, $\kappa_l \sim \SI{1}{\watt\per\meter\per\kelvin}$ and it decreases further at higher temperatures [@Zhao2014]. The quasi-two-dimensional nature of SnSe is also a natural 2D confinement of the charge carriers and provides a mechanism through which phonons are scattered, in line with the proposals by Hicks and Dresselhaus [@Hicks1993a]. Single-crystal tin selenide at ambient pressure is found in two phases, both of which are layered[@Chattopadhyay1986]: the low-temperature $Pnma$ phase (space group number 62) and the high-temperature $Cmcm$ phase (space group number 63). The in-plane thermoelectric figure-of-merit increases dramatically near the transition temperature $T_c$, and is maximized in the high-temperature $Cmcm$ phase. 

The $Cmcm$ phase is a better thermoelectric for three reasons. First, it has a smaller band gap (\SI{0.4}{\electronvolt}) compared to the $Pnma$ phase (\SI{0.6}{\electronvolt}) which results in an increased carrier concentration. Second, $Cmcm$ exhibits higher carrier mobilities than the $Pnma$ phase [@Zhao2014]. Finally, the lattice thermal conductivity is also low in the $Cmcm$ phase. Together, these properties make $Cmcm$ the better thermoelectric form of SnSe.

### Lattice instability and the $A_g$ soft mode

The $Pnma \to Cmcm$ phase transition is displacive second-order transition that is associated with the freezing of an optical $A_g$ mode at zone-center [@Chattopadhyay1986; @Dove1997]. Above $T_c$, the mode splits into two modes: an optical mode at $\Gamma$ polarized along the stacking axis $a$ and an acoustic mode polarized in the $b$--$c$ plane at $Y$. The in-plane section of the Brillouin zone is shown in @fig:snse-bz for context. Note that crystallographic directions are all given with respect to the low-temperature $Pnma$ phase. The $Cmcm$ phase is stabilized by strong anharmonicity between those two phonon modes[@Skelton2016; @Hong2019]. The softening of the $A_g$ mode in the $Pnma$ phase is thought to be due to an electronic instability. Simulations by Li *et al.* [@Li2015] show that the strength of a particular Sn-Se bond along the $c$ axis is especially sensitive to temperature, which is a concrete example of the coupling between lattice and electronic degrees-of-freedom in efficient thermoelectric materials.

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-bz file="figures/snse/bz.py" caption="In-plane section of the Brillouin zone of SnSe."}
```

In fact, there are many soft-modes with similar characteristics that soften towards the phase transition; $A_g$ simply happens to be the lowest-energy one, and therefore freezes at the phase transition. Work by Gong *et al.*[@Gong2020] and others[@Liu2018] has shown the temperature-dependence of multiple modes. Of interest is the $B_g$ mode (\SI{14}{\milli\electronvolt} at \SI{300}{\kelvin}), which is also polarized along the $Pnma$ lattice distortion just like the $A_g$ mode, but displays one of the most pronounced temperature-dependence across multiple two-dimensional systems such as black phosphorus, monolayer and few-layers MoS_2_, and graphene. This $B_g$ mode is of interest because it has been shown to be strongly coupled to the electronic system via simulations[@Caruso2019].

### Electronic instability

The electronic structure of SnSe is also of interest. The valence band of SnSe is primarily composed of Se-$4p$ orbitals, while the conduction band is primarily composed of Sn-$5p$ orbitals[@Li2015; @Cuong2015; @Kutorasinski2015; @Hong2019]. Moreover, different valence and conduction pockets in momentum space correspond to particular $p$-orbital polarizations [@Cuong2015]. SnSe is a p-type semiconductor (i.e. the top of the valence band is much closer to the Fermi energy than the bottom of the conduction band) with a indirect band gap in the $Pnma$ phase, and a direct band gap in the $Cmcm$. Interestingly, the *nature* of the band gap is strongly-dependent on the in-plane lattice parameters. Towards $T_c$, the $a$ and $b$ axes expand, while the $c$ axis contracts towards the length of the $b$ axis [@Chattopadhyay1986]. At \SI{300}{\kelvin}, the conduction band minimum is located at $\frac{2}{3}Y$ and is composed of Sn-$5p_y$ orbitals. At \SI{600}{\kelvin}, the conduction band minimum switches to a pocket of Sn-$5p_x$ at $\Gamma$. The valence band maximum for the $Pnma$ phase remains near $\frac{2}{3}Z$ across the temperature range and is composed of Se-$4p_z$ orbitals[^cuong]. The evolution of the electronic band structure along the $Z - \Gamma - Y$ line, based on the work by Wei *el al.* [@Wei2019], is shown in @fig:snse-electronic-structure.

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-electronic-structure file="figures/snse/estructure.py" caption="Schematic of the evolution of the electronic structure of SnSe in the $Pnma$ phase as temperature increases. At \SI{600}{\kelvin}, the conduction band minimum changes from $\frac{2}{3}Y$ to $\Gamma$; the crossing point is marked with a dashed line. The valence band maximum remains near $\frac{2}{3}Z$ across the temperature range."}

```

The low-temperature $Pnma$ phase is defined by the lattice vectors $\vec{a}_1 = a ~ \vec{e}_1$, $\vec{a}_2 = b ~ \vec{e}_2$, and $\vec{a}_3 = c ~ \vec{e}_3$ where $a=\SI{11.42}{\angstrom}$, $b=\SI{4.19}{\angstrom}$, and $c=\SI{4.46}{\angstrom}$. The vectors $\set{ \vec{e}_i }$ are understood to be the usual Euclidean vectors. The atomic positions are for the $Pnma$ phase are:

## Experimental methods

### Bulk crystal growth

Sample preparation involves two steps. Bulk crystals of SnSe were first synthesized, followed by processed by which ultrathin samples were produced.

Bulk SnSe crystals (\SI{20}{\gram}) were synthesized by mixing appropriate ratios of high purity starting materials (Sn chunk, 99.999\%, American Elements, USA and Se shot, 99.999\%, 5N Plus, Canada) in \SI{13}{\milli\meter} diameter quartz tube. The tube was flame-sealed at a residual pressure of $\SI{1e-4}{\mmHg}$, then slowly heated to \SI{1223}{\kelvin} over \SI{10}{\hour}, soaked at this temperature for 6h and subsequently furnace cooled to room temperature. The obtained ingot was crushed into powder and flame-sealed in a quartz tube, which was placed into another, bigger, flame-sealed quartz tube. A crystal with dimensions of $\sim$\SI{13}{\milli\meter} (diameter) $\times$ \SI{20}{\milli\meter} (length) was obtained. The bulk SnSe crystals were prepared for the author by Zhongzhen Luo of Northwestern University.

### Preparation of electron-transparent samples

In order to obtain ultrathin samples suitable for ultrafast electron scattering experiments, two methods were tried. Ultramicrotomy yielded suitable samples, but the author wanted to rule out the effect of strain induced by the sample preparation. To this end, a sample was also prepared via mechanical exfoliation.

#### Ultramicrotomy

Six samples were prepared via ultramicrotomy, a sample preparation technique which involves the cutting of samples using a diamond blade. While this technique has mostly been used to prepare organic samples for cryo-electron microscopy, it has been successfully used in the past decade to prepare samples of two-dimensional materials such as 4H-TaSe$_2$[@Erasmus2012], 1T-TaS$_2$[@Eichberger2013]. The author initially tried ultramicrotomy to prepare samples of 1T-TiSe$_2$[@Otto2020].

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-ultramicrotomy-femr file="figures/snse/ultramicrotome.py" caption="Ultramicrotome setup used to prepare SnSe samples, from two different angles. Crystals embedded in epoxy are mounted, and a diamond knife is used to shave a section. Sections slide down into a boat filled with water, where they are lated fished out. The images were provided by S. K. Sears from McGill University's Facility for Electron Microscopy Research."}
```

First, a bulk crystal of SnSe is embedded in epoxy, with the cutting plane parallel to the material layers. The surface of the bulk crystal is trimmed with a \ang{45} diamond blade to reveal fresh cutting surface. Sections are then cut with a sharper, \ang{35} diamond blade which then fall in a small water container. Floating sections are then fished out with a carbon-coated TEM grid. The assembly is shown in @fig:snse-ultramicrotomy-femr. The effect of cutting on the embedded crystals is shown in @fig:snse-ultramicrotomy. 

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-ultramicrotomy file="figures/snse/sample.py" caption="Stages of sample preparation via ultramicrotome. **a)** Prism of SnSe embedded in epoxy.  **b)** 4x magnification on the cut surface shown in a) shows large crystalline plateaus. **c)** Surface of embedded SnSe prism after trimming with a \ang{45} diamond knife. **d)** \SI{60}{\nano\meter} section of SnSe cut with a \ang{35} diamond knife. The images were provided by H. Gnaegi from Diatome, Ltd."}
```

The samples used in this work were prepared by J. Mui from the Facility for Electron Microscopy Research (FEMR) at McGill University. In the end, six samples were produced: three with a thickness of \SI{70}{\nano\meter} and three with a thickness of \SI{90}{\nano\meter}, each with an area of approximately \SI{200 x 200}{\micro\meter}. 

#### Mechanical exfoliation

An ultrathin flake of SnSe was prepared via mechanical exfoliation, a procedure that is analogous to the work by Novoselov *et al.*[@Novoselov2004]. A small chunk of SnSe was embedded in CrystalBond glue, on a standard \SI{3}{\milli\meter} copper TEM grid with a line spacing of 200 lines per inch. The embedded chunk was then exfoliated repeatedly using ordinary adhesive tape, until the embedded flake was translucent when observed with an optical microscope. The glue was washed away with acetone. This procedure resulted in a sample with an area of approximately \SI{50 x 50}{\micro\meter}.

The sample thickness was determined by taking the ratio of various reflections at thicknesses of \SI{70}{\nano\meter} and \SI{90}{\nano\meter} -- correcting for sample volume and electron flux -- and extrapolating to the intensity of the reflections in the exfoliated sample. Using this procedure, the thickness of the exfoliated sample was estimeted to be $\SI{30 \pm 5}{\nano\meter}$.

### Experimental parameters

The experiments presented in this chapter used the same experimental geometry that is presented in @sec:experimental_setup. Ultrashort laser pulses of \SI{1.55}{\electronvolt} light were shone on the sample surface, with an incident angle of \ang{10}, at $t=t_0$, on SnSe samples oriented in the $[100]$ direction. To ensure that the samples had enough time to cool down after every laser shot, the repetition rate of experiments were varied from \SIrange{50}{1000}{\hertz}, but no changes were measured beyond the degradation of signal-to-noise. Therefore, a \SI{1000}{\hertz} repetition rate was used. 

Compressed electron bunches of $10^6$ electrons per bunch were transmitted through the sample at $t=t_0 + \tau$, where the time-delay $\tau$ was scanned from \SIrange{-10}{30}{\pico\second}. The total range of time-delay $\tau$ was limited compared to graphite (\SIrange{-40}{680}{\pico\second}) because the diffuse signals are much weaker in SnSe; limiting the total range of time-delay allowed for more averaging. The flagship measurement presented in this chapter was taken over \SI{72}{\hour}. This was only possible thanks to the advancements in laser-RF synchronization brought by work by the author in Otto *et al.*[@Otto2017], which completely eliminated the drift in $t_0$ over the experiment duration.

The samples were photoexcited with a pump spot with a full-width at half-maximum that was at least twice the width of the sample, ensuring nearly-uniform illumination of the sample. The samples were photoexcited with photoexcitation densities ranging from \SIrange{6.6}{13.2}{\milli\joule\per\square\centi\meter}. The absorbed energy will be discussed further in this chapter. The scattering patterns were collected with a Gatan Ultrascan 895 camera, consisting of a 2.54 × 2.54 \si{\square\cm} phosphor screen fiber coupled to a 2048 px × 2048 px charge-coupled detector (CCD) placed \SI{29.39}{\centi\meter} away from the sample. Example static diffraction patterns are shown in 

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-diff-static file="figures/snse/diff-static.py" caption="Comparison of static diffraction patterns from samples prepared via two techniques. **a)** \SI{90}{\nano\meter}-thick sample prepared via ultramicrotome. **b)** \SI{30}{\nano\meter}-thick samples prepared via mechanical exfoliation."}
```

Contrary to the symmetrization procedure described in @sec:graphite-data-acquisition and shown in @fig:graphite-static, SnSe only has a two-fold symmetry in-plane. Therefore, the data presented in this chapter was *not* symmetrized.

## Ultrafast electron scattering measurements

The experimental results are presented in this section. The description will start with a presentation of the diffraction results, followed by the diffuse intensity dynamics.

### Bragg peak profile analysis{#sec:snse-bragg-peak-profile}

An important point which will anchor the discussion below is that the lattice dimensions are not affected by photoexcitation in the range of time-delay explored herein. All Bragg peaks were fit with a Gaussian profile at each time-delay, and the changes to their positions and profile were tracked. The results are presented in @fig:snse-peak-profiles for a few representative reflections. It is clear that no lattice expansion occurred in the measurements, which would have manifested itself as a change in Bragg peak position. Moreover, no lattice strain was measured, which would appear as a change in Bragg peak width. These checks are important given the strong dependence of SnSe's electronic bands on lattice dimensions[@Wei2019] and strain[@Cuong2015].

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-peak-profiles file="figures/snse/widths.py" caption="Dynamics of the width and position of various Bragg peaks following photoexcitation. For every time-delay, Bragg peaks were fit with a Gaussian function. In the right column, the change in full-width at half-maximum $\Delta \sigma$ is shown over time. In the left column, the absolute shift in the center position of the peak $\Delta x_c$ is shown, as a percentage of the average full-width at half-maximum $\bar{\sigma}$. For all plots, the error bars represent the covariance of fit parameter."}
```

### Debye-Waller dynamics

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-dwaller file="figures/snse/dwaller.py" caption="Differential intensity dynamics on Bragg peaks shows the transient Debye-Waller effect with two time-constants: \SI{400 \pm 100}{\femto\second} and \SI{4 \pm 1}{\pico\second}. Error bars represent the fluctuations before photoexcitation ($\tau < 0$) but are too small to see."}
```

The overall Bragg peak profiles were modified in one important way: a photoinduced amplitude change was measured, attributable to the transient Debye-Waller effect. All in-plane reflections show the same transient Debye-Waller dynamics: a biexponential decay with time constants \SI{400 \pm 100}{\femto\second} and \SI{4 \pm 1}{\pico\second}. A differential time-series combining a few reflections is shown in @fig:snse-dwaller. 

The two time-constants indicate that two physical processes follow photoexcitation. Recall from @eq:scattering-debye-waller that the Debye-Waller factor reports on the average mean-square-displacement of atoms $\langle |\vec{u}|^2 \rangle$. This increase in mean-square-displacement should be reflected in the diffuse intensity across the Brillouin zone.

### Large-wavevector phonons

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-highsym file="figures/snse/highsym.py" caption="Comparison of the diffuse intensity dynamics at various in-plane high-symmetry points. The fit to the average across the entire Brillouin zone where $|\vec{k}| > \SI{0.285}{\per\angstrom}$ is shown as a dashed black trace for reference."}
```

The slow dynamics (\SI{4 \pm 1}{\pico\second}) in the Debye-Waller dynamics are correlated with the uniform rise of diffuse intensity away from zone-center. @fig:snse-highsym shows the differential intensity changes at three high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone: $Y$, $Z$, and $T$. See @fig:snse-bz for the geometry of the in-plane section of the Brillouin zone. The diffuse intensity from the Brillouin zone near multiple reflection was averaged to increase signal-to-noise. The three in-plane points show the exact same dependence: a single exponential rise with time-constant $\SI{3.6 \pm 0.6}{\pico\second}$. For reference, the average across the Brillouin zone away from the zone-center ($|\vec{k}| > \SI{0.285}{\per\angstrom}$) is shown.


### Small wavevectors phonons{#sec:snse-small-wavevectors}

The rapid increase in mean-square-displacement following excitation is not due to large wavevector phonons. Recall that the $Pnma \to Cmcm$ phase transition involves the softening of many zone-center transverse optical modes polarized in the direction of the lattice distortion. 

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-diffuse-direction file="figures/snse/diffuse-direction.py" caption="Comparison of the differential intensity dynamics near reflections that are either almost parallel to $\vec{b}^\star$ or $\vec{c}^\star$. Near reflections almost parallel to $\vec{c}^\star$ (e.g. $(004)$, $(01\bar{7})$, etc.), a fast initial rise in intensity is observed which is not measured close to reflections almost parallel to $\vec{b}^\star$ (e.g. $(040)$, $(051)$, etc.)"}
```

Diffuse intensity dynamics correlated with the fast part of the Debye-Waller dynamics are indeed observed near zone-center. The one-phonon structure factors are expected to be large for the transverse optical modes polarized in the $c$ direction near reflections that are almost parallel to the $\vec{c}^\star$ axis. @fig:snse-diffuse-direction shows the integration of the total scattering intensity in a *ring* around reflections that are either nearly parallel to $\vec{b}^\star$ or $\vec{c}^\star$. 

These signals will be isolated appropriately and discussed in the next section.

## Diffuse dynamics of soft transverse optical modes

In this section, the initial findings presented in @sec:snse-small-wavevectors will be developed further. There are two tasks at hand: confirm that the dynamics at zone-center are due to diffuse scattering, and separate isolate this trace from the nearby Bragg peak dynamics.

### Confirmation of diffuse dynamics via multiple scattering

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-forbidden-location file="figures/snse/static-forbidden.py" caption="Location of reflections which are forbidden in the $Pnma$ phase. These reflections are visible due to double diffraction."}
```

The intensity dynamics shown in @fig:snse-diffuse-direction can be confirmed to be due to dynamics in the diffuse intensity by performing experiments on a thick sample. Note that the thicker SnSe sample prepared by ultramicrotome show some degree of double diffraction, in the form of *forbidden reflections*. The $Pnma$ space group has a non-zero structure factor (@eq:scattering-potential-crystal) for following in-plane reflections:
$$
    \set{ (0kl) \mid k + l \in 2\mathbb{Z} }
$$
where $2\mathbb{Z}$ is understood to be the set of even integers. Forbidden reflections present in the thicker SnSe samples are indicated in @fig:snse-forbidden-location. While double diffraction is visible, the cross-section of a scattering event composed of a diffraction and diffuse scattering event is much less likely (see @sec:scattering-multiple). A comparison of the differential intensity dynamics near allowed and forbidden reflections is shown in @fig:snse-forbidden. For both allowed and forbidden reflections, only those which are roughly parallel to the $\vec{c}^\star$ axis were used. It is clear that the fast intensity increase is not present near the zone-center of reflections which result from double diffraction, which confirms that the ultrafast rise in intensity initially shown in @sec:snse-small-wavevectors is diffuse in nature.

### Partitioning of the Brillouin zone{#sec:snse-regions}

In order to be more quantitative about the diffuse intensity dynamics at zone center, the intensity dynamics of the Bragg peaks need to be removed. Directly on the Bragg peaks, the absolute intensity change observed in fig:snse-dwaller is 10^5^ times larger than the diffuse rise observed in @fig:snse-diffuse-direction. The transient Debye-Waller effect suppresses diffracted intensity, but does not change the peak profile. Therefore, there must be a region in reciprocal space -- far enough away from the peak location -- where the absolute change in peak intensity due to the transient Debye-Waller effect is on the same order as the diffuse rise.

```

By looking in a *ring* around Bragg peaks, the intensity dynamics can be separated between Debye-Waller (inner disk) and diffuse intensity near zone-center (outer torus) defined by:
\begin{align}
    \Omega_{\text{region 1}} &= \left\{ \vec{k} \mid |\vec{k}| < r \right\} \\
    \Omega_{\text{region 2}} &= \left\{ \vec{k} \mid r \leq |\vec{k}| \leq 2 r \right\} \label{eq:snse-region-2}\\
    \Omega_{\text{region 3}} &= \left\{ \vec{k} \mid 2 r < |\vec{k}| \right\}
\end{align}{#eq:}
The amplitude of the diffuse rise at zone-center is affected by the parameter $r$,but the time-constants are not. @fig:snse-size-comparison shows the intensity dynamics when integrating in region 2, for various parameters of $r$. In all cases, the differential intensity dynamics are well-described by a biexponential function. The relative amplitudes of the two exponentials determines the overall shape of the curves, as all the time-constants are comparable. The fitting results are summarized in @tbl:snse-size-comparison. The optimal sizes of the inner and outer radii, as defined by the dimensions which maximize the amplitude of the diffuse rise has $r = \SI{0.114}{\per\angstrom}$; this geometry is shown in @fig:snse-geometry. Region 1 and 2 are fairly small, considering that the in-plane Brillouin zone is \SI{1.49 x 1.41}{\per\angstrom} in size.

## Discussion

With the appropriate partitioning of the Brillouin zone, it is possible to separate the dynamics of the Bragg peak from the diffuse intensity at zone-center. The diffuse dynamics at zone-center presented in the previous section are definitely affected to some degree by the dynamics of the nearby Bragg peak. However, because it has been shown that the Bragg peak profiles are constant, the Debye-Waller dynamics from region 1 can be subtracted. The results are presented in @fig:snse-clean-traces. Most importantly, this reveals that the slow diffuse intensity decrease near zone-center is *not due* to the nearby Bragg peak, but is rather intrinsic to the diffuse dynamics.

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-clean-traces file="figures/snse/clean-traces.py" caption="Transient ultrafast electron scattering intensity at various points in the Brillouin zone. The integration geometry is shown in @fig:snse-geometry. The decrease of intensity directly on the Bragg peak shows the expected transient Debye-Waller effect with fast and slow components. Average transient diffuse intensity across region 3 is shown for context. Error bars represent the standard error in the mean of intensity before time-zero, but are generally smaller than the markers."}

Recall the definition for the diffuse intensity (@eq:scattering-diffuse-intensity):
$$
    I_1(\vec{q}) \propto \sum_{\lambda} \frac{n_{\lambda}(\vec{k}) + 1/2}{\omega_{\lambda}(\vec{k})} |F_{1\lambda}(\vec{q})|^2
$$
This equation implies an increase of diffuse intensity at zone center is due to an increase in $(n_{\lambda}+1/2) / \omega_{\lambda}$ for one or more transverse optical modes at $\vec{k}=\vec{0}$. UEDS measurements do not contain enough information to deconvolve the effects of selective mode-heating ($\uparrow n_{\lambda}$) and/or softening ($\downarrow \omega_{\lambda}$). In fact, there are indications at equilibrium that both terms may be involved in the diffuse intensity rise at zone center, given that calculations show that some zone-center optical modes like $B_g$ are strongly-coupled to the electronic system [@Caruso2019]. Intuitively, the author expected that strong electron-phonon coupling might reduce the thermoelectric figure-of-merit by strongly modulating electron mobilities. However, work by Fan *et al.* [@Fan2018] has shown that the onset of strong electron-phonon coupling may reduce the lattice thermal conductivity in a way that increases the $ZT$ figure-of-merit overall. Therefore, it is not possible to rule out selective mode-heating as a potential explanation for the diffuse intensity rise at $\Gamma$.

In analogy to @eq:scattering-displacement, the factors $n_{\lambda} + 1/2 / \omega_{\lambda}$ are related to vibrational amplitude. Therefore, the discussion will continue in terms of mode-projected vibrational amplitudes:
$$
    I_1(\vec{q}) \propto \sum_{\lambda} \left| a_{\lambda}(\vec{k})\right|^2 |F_{1\lambda}(\vec{q})|^2
$$
where
$$
    \left|a_{\lambda}(\vec{k}) \right|^2 = \frac{n_{\lambda}(\vec{k})+1/2}{\omega_{\lambda}(\vec{k})}
$$
In this formulation, the fast diffuse intensity rise at $\Gamma$ is due to an increase in vibrational amplitude of one or more transverse optical modes polarized in the direction of the $Pnma$ phase distortion.

### Fluence-dependence

The fluence-dependence on the increase in vibrational amplitude of zone-center transverse optical modes was investigated.

```{.matplotlib file="figures/snse/displacement.py" caption="Increase in mean-square-displacement of all atoms $\Delta \langle u^2 \rangle$, due to the change in vibrational amplitude of the soft zone-center optical modes exclusively. Boxes are used to represent error bars along both axes. Color bar shows associated photocarrier density $N_{\gamma}$."}

### Ultrafast phonon softening from intensity dynamics

Extracting the change in the $A_g$ phonon frequency $\omega(\vec{k}=\vec{\Gamma}, \tau)$ from the diffuse intensity is technically possible. Consider the change in diffuse intensity at $\vec{k} \approx \vec{0}$:
\begin{align}
    I_1(\tau) - I_1(0) & = I_e \sum_{\lambda} \frac{n_{\lambda}(\tau) + 1/2}{\omega_{\lambda}(\tau)} \left| F_{1\lambda}\right|^2 - I_e \sum_{\lambda} \frac{n_{\lambda}(0) + 1/2}{\omega_{\lambda}(0)} \left| F_{1\lambda}\right|^2 \nonumber \\
                      & =  I_e \sum_{\lambda} \left| F_{1\lambda}\right|^2 \left( \frac{n_{\lambda}(\tau) + 1/2}{\omega_{\lambda}(\tau)} - \frac{n_{\lambda}(0) + 1/2}{\omega_{\lambda}(0)} \right)
\end{align}
where the prefactors in @eq:scattering-diffuse-intensity have all been collected in the quantity $I_e$. Photoexcitation results in a single mode $\lambda=A_g$ softening, so that $n_{\lambda}(0) = n_{\lambda}(\tau) \forall \lambda$ and $\omega_{\lambda}(0) = \omega_{\lambda}(\tau) \forall \lambda \setminus \left\{ A_g \right\}$. Then:
$$
    I_1(\tau) - I_1(0) = I_e \left| F_{1 A_g}\right|^2 (n_{A_g}(0) + 1/2) \left( \frac{1}{\omega_{A_g}(\tau)} - \frac{1}{\omega_{A_g}(0)}\right)
$$.
Therefore, determining the $A_g$ mode softening from the diffuse intensity dynamics requires the calculation of the one-phonon structure factors. The reason this was not possible is twofold. First, the author is not competent in the use of density-functional-theory software suites such as Quantum Espresso. Second, calculations have repeatedly failed to capture the physics of SnSe [@Pletikosic2018]. Therefore, another, more robust approach was taken instead. 

Given that the softening of a phonon mode manifests itself as an increase vibrational amplitude, it is possible to extract the softening of the $A_g$ mode by looking at the fast component of the transient Debye-Waller dynamics on the Bragg peak. The time-resolved suppression of Bragg intensity due to atomic vibrations is given by the following expression (@eq:scattering-diffracted-intensity-finite-temp):
\begin{align}
    \frac{I_0(\vec{q},\tau) - I_0(\vec{q},0)}{I_0(\vec{q},0)} 
        &\equiv \Delta I_0(\vec{q},\tau) \nonumber \\
        &= \frac{\left[e^{-2M(\vec{q},\tau)} - e^{-2M(\vec{q},0)}\right]}{e^{-2M(\vec{q},0)}} \nonumber \\
        &=e^{-2[M(\vec{q},\tau) - M(\vec{q},0)]} - 1
\end{align}
Rearranging terms:
$$
    - \frac{1}{2} \ln \left[1 + \Delta I_0(\vec{q},t) \right] = 2 \pi^2 |\vec{q}|^2 \Delta \langle u^2\rangle
$$
