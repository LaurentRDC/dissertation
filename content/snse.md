# On the origins of thermoelectricity in tin selenide {#sec:snse}

Ultrafast electron scattering is an ideal tool in the study of materials and systems in which charge carriers and the lattice do not behave in a concomitant manner. An example of such systems are charge-density wave materials like 1T-TaSe$_2$[@Shi2019;@Ji2020] and 1T-TiSe$_2$[@Kogar2017;@Otto2021], where the electron density can morph into a periodic structure which might or might not be commensurate with the lattice periodicity. Thermoelectric materials are another class of systems where the charge carriers and the lattice are not on the same page[@Mahan1996]. In such materials, a thermal gradient also generates an electrical current due to discrepancy between the electrical and thermal conductivities, the former being larger than the latter. 

Thermoelectric materials are of broad interest because can be used to harvest waste heat and transform this energy into useable electrical power [@Snyder2008;@Sootsman2009;@Zebarjadi2012]. The Perseverance rover, which has just landed at this time of writing these words, uses thermoelectrics to convert the heat generated by the natural radioactive decay of plutonium dioxide as a main power source [@Perseverance2021]. The combination of thermal and electrical properties that make a good thermoelectric material is not found in nature; efficient thermoelectrics must be engineered. It will be described later that the relevant parameters that can be controlled by materials scientist are all interdependent, which makes the optimization of thermoelectrics an arduous task.

Ultrafast methodologies in general have the ability to disentangle couplings between excitations by distinguishing relaxation time-scales. What may appear intrinsic at equilibrium might be revealed as a complex interplay in ultrafast measurements. And yet, ultrafast methodologies have rarely been applied to thermoelectric materials. This presents an opportunity to revolutionize the understanding of thermoelectrics which has only seen incremental progress in the past fifteen years.

In this chapter, the author seeks to understand one of the most performant thermoelectric materials, SnSe, and how to improve its thermoelectric efficiency at room temperature.

## The determinants of thermoelectric efficiency

The performance of a thermoelectric material is measured via the figure-of-merit $ZT$:
$$
    ZT = S^2 \frac{\sigma}{\kappa_e + \kappa_l}T
$${#eq:snse-zt}
where $S$ is the so-called Seebeck coefficient, $\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity, $\kappa_e$ and $\kappa_l$ are the thermal conductivities for the charge carriers and the lattice respectively, and $T$ is the absolute temperature[@Telkes1947]. $ZT$ is an important figure of merit because it is used to describe the efficiency of a thermoelectric module. Consider a device with a cold side at temperature $T_C$, and a hot side at temperature $T_H$. The heat harvesting efficiency is given by:
$$
\eta = \frac{T_H - T_C}{T_H} \left( \frac{\sqrt{1 + ZT_{avg}} - 1}{\sqrt{1 + ZT_{avg}} + \frac{T_C}{T_H}} \right)
$$
where $T_{avg} = \sfrac{(T_C + T_H)}{2}$ is the average device temperature, and $\sfrac{(T_H - T_C)}{T_H}$ is understood to be the Carnot efficiency[@Sootsman2009;@Zhang2014]. The value of $\eta$ for an abstract device is shown in @fig:snse-efficiency. This figure illustrates that good efficiency at reasonable temperatures ($<$\SI{450}{\kelvin}) requires a high $ZT$.

```

### The Seebeck coefficient

The Seebeck coefficient is a measure of how much voltage can be induced by a temperature gradient, usually expressed in units of \si{\micro\volt\per\kelvin}. It is negative (positive) for n-type (p-type) semiconductors. The Seebeck coefficient for a few elements are listed in @tbl:snse-seebeck-coefficients. The Seebeck coefficient is highest for Selenium and Tellurium, while being vanishingly small for good conductors such as Gold and Platinum.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption[Seebeck coefficients for a few selected elements.]{Seebeck coefficients for a few selected elements\autocite{Rowe1995}.}
	\vspace{2mm}
	\begin{tabular}{c | c}
		Element & Seebeck Coefficient [\si{\micro \volt \per \kelvin}] \\ \hline\hline
		Selenium  & 895 \\ \hline
        Tellurium & 495 \\ \hline

        Bismuth   & -67 \\ \hline
	\end{tabular} 
	\label{tbl:snse-seebeck-coefficients}
\end{table}

For a solid that is well-described by parabolic electronic bands, the Seebeck coefficient can be expressed as [@Rittner1959]:
$$
    S = - \frac{k_B}{e} \left( \frac{5 F_{3/2}(\bar{\mu})}{3 F_{1/2}(\bar{\mu})} - \bar{\mu}\right)
$${#eq:snse-seebeck}
where $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, $e$ is the quantum of charge, $\bar{\mu}=\mu/k_B T$ is the reduced chemical potential (relative to the edge of the conduction band), and $F_i$ is the Fermi-Dirac function defined as:
$$
    F_i(\bar{\mu})= \int_0^\infty dx \frac{x^i}{e^{x - \bar{\mu}} + 1}
$$
The above equation makes it clear that the Seebeck coefficient is largely determined by the value of the reduced chemical potential, and thus is mostly sensitive to doping [@Hicks1993a].

### Electronic transport

The thermoelectric figure-of-merit (@eq:snse-zt) is directly proportional to the DC electrical conductivity $\sigma$. For a given material, the conductivity can be improved via charge-carrier doping[@Rowe1995;@Bennett2017], which is also known to negatively affect the Seebeck coefficient [@Sootsman2009;@Ikeda2010;@Fiorentini2016]. Therefore, the improvement of the term $S^2 \sigma$ via charge-carrier doping reaches a maximum at some optimum carrier concentration[@Bennett2017], which limits the overall potential for thermoelectric performance gains. 

There is another complication related to targeted improvements in DC conductivity. Increasing the electrical conductivity of any material also necessarily increases the electronic contribution of the thermal conductivity. In fact, the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity is directly proportional to the DC electrical conductivity, a phenomenon known as the *Wiedemann-Franz* law [@Franz1853].

### Dimensionality-reduction

On the more practical, device-driven side of things, the thermoelectric figure-of-merit can be dramatically improved via nanostructuring. In two seminal papers, Hicks and Dresselhaus [@Hicks1993a;@Hicks1993b] described the desireable effects of dimensionality reduction (nanosheets and quantum wires) on the both $S^2 \sigma$ and $\kappa_l$. With respect to electronic transport, quantum confinement pseudo-discretizes the electronic density-of-states[@Heremans2013]; with the appropriate doping, the power factor[^powerfactor] $S^2 \sigma$ can be dramatically improved[@Hicks1996]. Nanostructuring also reduces the lattice thermal conductivity. The reduction in phonon mean-free-path at interfaces is appreciable[@Kapitza1971;@Rowe1974], and this is no different in nanostructured devices[@Joshi2008]. 

However, the maximum performance of nanostructured thermoelectrics -- while enhanced -- is still limited by the intrinsic thermoelectric performance of the underlying bulk material.

### Lattice thermal conductivity

The last major thermoelectric tuning parameter is the lattice thermal conductivity, which has been historically considered independent from electronic structure changes. The canonical way to alter the lattice heat transport properties from a given compound is to introduce defects via solid solutions[@Wang2013].

Which bulk compounds should be used as a starting point for further performance improvements? From the point-of-view of low lattice thermal conductivity, the ideal material has been called a *phonon glass--electron crystal* [@Rowe1995PGEC]. The prototypical phonon glass--electron crystal is a low-symmetry material with heavy atoms that are somewhat free to vibrate, resulting in an intrisically-low thermal conductivity (phonon glass), but with high-enough electron mobility (electron crystal). Well-known phonon glass--electron crystals include Bi$_2$Se$_3$[@Hicks1993a](also a topological insulator [@Sobota2012]), PbTe[@Harman1996], and more recently SnSe[@Zhao2014].

[^powerfactor]: The term power factor is an unfortunate misnomer, as it does not relate to energy flow over time. It is used here for historical coherence.

## Tin selenide

Tin selenide (SnSe) is a layered mono-chalcogen which has attracted attention in the past few years because of its very high thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$, especially at high temperature, as reported by Zhao *et al.* [@Zhao2014] and others[@Zhao2016a;@Zhao2016b]. While the exact value of this figure of merit is debated [@Wei2016], SnSe remains one of the most promising bulk thermoelectric materials[^zt-fully-dense]. The axis-projected $ZT$ based on the work by Zhao *et al.* [@Zhao2014] is shown in @fig:snse-zt. SnSe is interesting not only from a scientific standpoint but also from a practical one, because it is lead-free (non-toxic) and composed of earth-abundant elements. SnSe has also been suggested as an air-stable alternative to black phosphorus in real-world applications[@Li2014;@Ling2015;@Wu2016].

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-zt file="figures/snse/zt.py" caption="Thermoelectric figure-of-merit $ZT$ along the crystallographic axes of SnSe."}
```

SnSe's high thermoelectric efficiency is primarily due to an anomalously-low lattice thermal conductivity, especially in-plane. At room temperature, $\kappa_l \sim \SI{1}{\watt\per\meter\per\kelvin}$ and it decreases further at higher temperatures [@Zhao2014]. The quasi-two-dimensional nature of SnSe is also a natural confinement of the charge carriers and provides a mechanism through which phonons are scattered, in line with the proposals by Hicks and Dresselhaus [@Hicks1993a]. Single-crystal tin selenide at ambient pressure is found in two phases, both of which are layered[@Chattopadhyay1986]: the low-temperature $Pnma$ phase (space group number 62) and the high-temperature $Cmcm$ phase (space group number 63). The in-plane thermoelectric figure-of-merit increases dramatically near the transition temperature $T_c$, and is maximized in the high-temperature $Cmcm$ phase. 

The $Cmcm$ phase is a better thermoelectric for three reasons. First, it has a smaller band gap (\SI{0.4}{\electronvolt}) compared to the $Pnma$ phase (\SI{0.6}{\electronvolt}) which results in an increased carrier concentration. Second, $Cmcm$ exhibits higher carrier mobilities than the $Pnma$ phase [@Zhao2014]. Finally, the lattice thermal conductivity is also low in the $Cmcm$ phase. Together, these properties make $Cmcm$ the better thermoelectric form of SnSe.

### Lattice instability and zone-center soft modes

In the high-temperature $Cmcm$ phase, the lattice is stabilized by two soft, anharmonically-coupled phonon modes: an optical mode at $\Gamma$ polarized along the stacking axis $a$ and an acoustic mode polarized in the $b$--$c$ plane at $Y$[@Skelton2016;@Hong2019]. The in-plane section of the Brillouin zone is shown in @fig:snse-bz for context. When cooling towards the phase transition temperature $T_c$, both modes freeze, which reduces the Brillouin zone volume as every $Y$ point in the $Cmcm$ phase becomes zone-center in the $Pnma$ phase. Below $T_c$, the two anharmonically-coupled modes of the $Cmcm$ phase combine into a single soft mode called $A_g$, which is polarized mostly along the $c$ axis with a small component along the stacking axis $a$. This $A_g$ soft mode in the $Pnma$ phase hardens when cooling away from $T_c$ [@Chattopadhyay1986;@Dove1997].

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-bz file="figures/snse/bz.py" caption="In-plane section of the Brillouin zone of SnSe."}
```

There are actually many soft-modes with characteristics similar to the lowest energy $A_g$ mode that soften towards the phase transition; $A_g$ simply happens to be the lowest-energy one, and therefore freezes at the phase transition. Work by Gong *et al.*[@Gong2020] and others[@Liu2018] has shown the temperature-dependence of multiple modes. Of interest is the $B_g$ mode (\SI{14}{\milli\electronvolt} at \SI{300}{\kelvin}), which is also polarized along the $Pnma$ lattice distortion just like the $A_g$ mode, but displays one of the most pronounced temperature-dependence across multiple two-dimensional systems such as black phosphorus, monolayer and few-layers MoS$_2$, and graphene.

### Electronic structure

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-electronic-structure file="figures/snse/estructure.py" caption="In-plane electronic dispersion $E(\vect{k})$ for tin selenide at room temperature."}
```

The electronic structure of SnSe is also of interest. The in-plane electronic dispersion at room temperature based on calculations[@Cuong2015;@Ma2018;@Wei2019] is shown in @fig:snse-electronic-structure.

The valence band of SnSe is primarily composed of Se-$4p$ orbitals, while the conduction band is primarily composed of Sn-$5p$ orbitals[@Li2015;@Cuong2015;@Kutorasinski2015;@Hong2019]. Moreover, different valence and conduction pockets in momentum space correspond to particular $p$-orbital polarizations [@Cuong2015]. SnSe is a p-type semiconductor with an indirect band gap in the $Pnma$ phase, and a direct band gap in the $Cmcm$. In the $Pnma$ phase in particular, the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum are located near the $Z$ and $Y$ points, respectively[@Ma2018]. The shape of the valence band maximum near $Z$ -- known as "pudding mold" shape -- is thought to strongly-improve the power factor $S^2\sigma$[@Kuroki2007]. 

Interestingly, the *nature* of the band gap is strongly-dependent on the in-plane lattice parameters. Towards $T_c$, the $a$ and $b$ axes expand, while the $c$ axis contracts towards the length of the $b$ axis [@Chattopadhyay1986]. At \SI{300}{\kelvin}, the conduction band minimum is located at $\frac{2}{3}Y$ and is composed of Sn-$5p_y$ orbitals. At \SI{600}{\kelvin}, the conduction band minimum switches to a pocket of Sn-$5p_x$ at $\Gamma$[@Wei2019]. The valence band maximum for the $Pnma$ phase remains near $Z$ across the temperature range and is composed of Se-$4p_z$ orbitals[^cuong]. Above the phase transition temperature $T_c$, the valence band minimum moves to the $\Gamma$ point, and thus the band gap becomes direct.

### Structural parameters

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-structure file="figures/snse/structure.py" caption="Atomic structure for two phases of SnSe. **a)** $Pnma$ (low-temperature) phase. **b)** $Cmcm$ (high-temperature) phase."}
```

The low-temperature $Pnma$ phase is defined by the lattice vectors $\vect{a}_1 = a ~ \vect{e}_1$, $\vect{a}_2 = b ~ \vect{e}_2$, and $\vect{a}_3 = c ~ \vect{e}_3$ where $a=\SI{11.42}{\angstrom}$, $b=\SI{4.19}{\angstrom}$, and $c=\SI{4.46}{\angstrom}$. The vectors $\set{ \vect{e}_i }$ are understood to be the usual Euclidean vectors. The atomic positions are for the $Pnma$ phase are:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
    \vect{\text{Se}}_1 \\
    \vect{\text{Se}}_2 \\
    \vect{\text{Se}}_3 \\
    \vect{\text{Se}}_4 \\
    \vect{\text{Sn}}_1 \\
    \vect{\text{Sn}}_2 \\
    \vect{\text{Sn}}_3 \\
    \vect{\text{Sn}}_4 
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
    0.14 & \sfrac{3}{4} & 0.52\\
    0.36 & \sfrac{1}{4} & 0.02\\
    0.64 & \sfrac{3}{4} & 0.98\\
    0.86 & \sfrac{1}{4} & 0.48\\
    0.12 & \sfrac{1}{4} & 0.09\\
    0.38 & \sfrac{3}{4} & 0.59\\
    0.62 & \sfrac{1}{4} & 0.41\\
    0.88 & \sfrac{3}{4} & 0.91
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
    \vect{a}_1 \\
    \vect{a}_2 \\
    \vect{a}_3
\end{pmatrix}
$$
In monolayer form, SnSe is ferroelectric[@Wu2016;@Fei2016].

The lattice vectors for the *conventional cell* of high-temperature phase $Cmcm$ are given by $\vect{a}_1 = a ~ \vect{e}_1$, $\vect{a}_2 = b ~ \vect{e}_2$, and $\vect{a}_3 = b ~ \vect{e}_3$ where $a=\SI{11.71}{\angstrom}$ and $b=\SI{4.31}{\angstrom}$. The atomic positions in fractional coordinates are:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
    \vect{\text{Se}}_1 \\
    \vect{\text{Se}}_2 \\
    \vect{\text{Se}}_3 \\
    \vect{\text{Se}}_4 \\
    \vect{\text{Sn}}_1 \\
    \vect{\text{Sn}}_2 \\
    \vect{\text{Sn}}_3 \\
    \vect{\text{Sn}}_4 
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
    0.14 & \sfrac{1}{2}  & \sfrac{3}{4}\\
    0.36 & 0             & \sfrac{1}{4}\\
    0.64 & 0             & \sfrac{3}{4}\\
    0.86 & \sfrac{1}{2}  & \sfrac{1}{4}\\
    0.12 & 0             & \sfrac{1}{4}\\

\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
    \vect{a}_1 \\
    \vect{a}_2 \\
    \vect{a}_3
\end{pmatrix}
$$
The primitive cell for the $Pnma$ phase is twice the size of the primitive cell for the $Cmcm$ phase. For convenience, the conventional cells are used throughout this chapter. The atomic structures are shown in @fig:snse-structure.

## Experimental methods

### Bulk crystal growth

Sample preparation involves two steps. Bulk crystals of SnSe were first synthesized, followed by processed by which ultrathin samples were produced.

Bulk SnSe crystals (\SI{20}{\gram}) were synthesized by mixing appropriate ratios of high purity starting materials (Sn chunk, 99.999\%, American Elements, USA and Se shot, 99.999\%, 5N Plus, Canada) in \SI{13}{\milli\meter} diameter quartz tube. The tube was flame-sealed at a residual pressure of $\SI{1e-4}{\mmHg}$, then slowly heated to \SI{1223}{\kelvin} over \SI{10}{\hour}, soaked at this temperature for 6h and subsequently furnace cooled to room temperature. The obtained ingot was crushed into powder and flame-sealed in a quartz tube, which was placed into another, bigger, flame-sealed quartz tube. A crystal with dimensions of $\sim$\SI{13}{\milli\meter} (diameter) $\times$ \SI{20}{\milli\meter} (length) was obtained.

### Preparation of electron-transparent samples

In order to obtain ultrathin samples suitable for ultrafast electron scattering experiments, two methods were tried. Ultramicrotomy yielded suitable samples, but the author wanted to rule out the effect of strain induced by the sample preparation. To this end, a sample was also prepared via mechanical exfoliation.

#### Ultramicrotomy

Six samples were prepared via ultramicrotomy, a sample preparation technique which involves the cutting of samples using a diamond blade. While this technique has mostly been used to prepare organic samples for cryo-electron microscopy, it has been successfully used in the past decade to prepare samples of two-dimensional materials such as 4H-TaSe$_2$[@Erasmus2012] and 1T-TaS$_2$[@Eichberger2013]. The author initially tried ultramicrotomy to prepare samples of 1T-TiSe$_2$[@Otto2021].

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-ultramicrotomy-femr file="figures/snse/ultramicrotome.py" caption="Ultramicrotome setup used to prepare SnSe samples. Crystals embedded in epoxy are mounted, and a diamond knife is used to shave a section. Sections slide down into a boat filled with water, where they are lated fished out. This image was provided by S. K. Sears from McGill University's Facility for Electron Microscopy Research."}
```

First, a bulk crystal of SnSe is embedded in epoxy, with the cutting plane parallel to the material layers. The surface of the bulk crystal is trimmed with a \ang{45} diamond blade to reveal fresh cutting surface. Sections are then cut with a sharper, \ang{35} diamond blade which then fall in a small water container. Floating sections are then fished out with a carbon-coated TEM grid. The assembly is shown in @fig:snse-ultramicrotomy-femr. The effect of cutting on the embedded crystals is shown in @fig:snse-ultramicrotomy.

The images were provided by H. Gnaegi from Diatome, Ltd."}
```

The samples used in this work were prepared by J. Mui from the Facility for Electron Microscopy Research (FEMR) at McGill University. In the end, six samples were produced: three with a thickness of \SI{70}{\nano\meter} and three with a thickness of \SI{90}{\nano\meter}, each with an area of approximately \SI{200 x 200}{\micro\meter}. 

#### Mechanical exfoliation

An ultrathin flake of SnSe was prepared via mechanical exfoliation, a procedure that is analogous to the work by Novoselov *et al.*[@Novoselov2004] A small chunk of SnSe was embedded in CrystalBond glue, on a standard \SI{3}{\milli\meter} copper TEM grid with a line spacing of 200 lines per inch. The embedded chunk was then exfoliated repeatedly using ordinary adhesive tape, until the embedded flake was translucent when observed with an optical microscope. The glue was washed away with acetone. This procedure resulted in a sample with an area of approximately \SI{50 x 50}{\micro\meter}.

The sample thickness was determined by taking the ratio of various reflections at thicknesses of \SI{70}{\nano\meter} and \SI{90}{\nano\meter} -- correcting for sample volume and electron flux -- and extrapolating to the intensity of the reflections in the exfoliated sample. Using this procedure, the thickness of the exfoliated sample was estimated to be $\SI{45 \pm 5}{\nano\meter}$.

### Experimental parameters

The experiments presented in this chapter used the same experimental geometry that is presented in @sec:experimental_setup. Ultrashort laser pulses of \SI{1.55}{\electronvolt} light were shone on the sample surface, with an incident angle of \ang{10}, at $t=t_0$, on SnSe samples oriented in the $[100]$ direction. To ensure that the samples had enough time to cool down after every laser shot, the repetition rate of experiments were varied from \SIrange{50}{1000}{\hertz}, but no changes were measured beyond the degradation of signal-to-noise. Therefore, a \SI{1000}{\hertz} repetition rate was used. 

Compressed electron bunches of $10^6$ electrons per bunch were transmitted through the sample at $t=t_0 + \tau$, where the time-delay $\tau$ was scanned from \SIrange{-10}{30}{\pico\second}. The total range of time-delay $\tau$ was limited compared to graphite (\SIrange{-40}{680}{\pico\second}) because the diffuse signals are much weaker in SnSe; limiting the total range of time-delay allowed for more averaging. The flagship measurement presented in this chapter was taken over \SI{72}{\hour}. This was only possible thanks to the advancements in laser-RF synchronization brought by work by the author in Otto *et al.*[@Otto2017], which completely eliminated the drift in $t_0$ over the experiment duration.

The samples were photoexcited with a pump spot with a full-width at half-maximum that was at least twice the width of the sample, ensuring nearly-uniform illumination of the sample. The samples were photoexcited with photoexcitation densities ranging from \SIrange{6.6}{13.2}{\milli\joule\per\square\centi\meter}. The absorbed energy will be discussed further in this chapter. The scattering patterns were collected with a Gatan Ultrascan 895 camera, consisting of a 2.54 × 2.54 \si{\square\cm} scintillator fiber-coupled to a 2048 px × 2048 px charge-coupled detector (CCD) placed \SI{29.39}{\centi\meter} away from the sample. Example static diffraction patterns are shown in @fig:snse-diff-static.

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-diff-static file="figures/snse/diff-static.py" caption="Comparison of static diffraction patterns from samples prepared via two techniques. **a)** \SI{90}{\nano\meter}-thick sample prepared via ultramicrotome. **b)** \SI{45}{\nano\meter}-thick samples prepared via mechanical exfoliation."}
```

Contrary to the symmetrization procedure described in @sec:graphite-data-acquisition and shown in @fig:graphite-static, SnSe only has a two-fold symmetry in-plane. Therefore, the data presented in this chapter was *not* symmetrized.

## Ultrafast electron scattering measurements

The experimental results are presented in this section. The description will start with a presentation of the diffraction results, followed by the diffuse intensity dynamics.

### Bragg peak profile analysis{#sec:snse-bragg-peak-profile}

An important point which will anchor the discussion below is that the lattice dimensions are not affected by photoexcitation in the range of time-delay explored herein. All Bragg peaks were fit with a Gaussian profile at each time-delay, and the changes to their positions and profile were tracked. The results are presented in @fig:snse-peak-profiles for a few representative reflections. It is clear that no lattice expansion occurred in the measurements, which would have manifested itself as a change in Bragg peak position. Moreover, no lattice strain was measured, which would appear as a change in Bragg peak width[@Fultz2013Lineshapes]. These checks are important given the strong dependence of SnSe's electronic bands on lattice dimensions[@Wei2019] and strain[@Cuong2015].

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-peak-profiles file="figures/snse/widths.py" caption="Dynamics of the width and position of various Bragg peaks following photoexcitation. For every time-delay, Bragg peaks were fit with a Gaussian function. In the right column, the change in full-width at half-maximum $\Delta \sigma$ is shown over time. In the left column, the absolute shift in the center position of the peak $\Delta x_c$ is shown, as a percentage of the average full-width at half-maximum $\bar{\sigma}$. For all plots, the error bars represent the covariance of fit parameter."}
```

### Debye-Waller dynamics

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-dwaller file="figures/snse/dwaller.py" caption="Differential intensity dynamics on Bragg peaks for reflections either parallel to $\vect{b}^\star$ or $\vect{c}^\star$. Reflections parallel to $\vect{b}^\star$ are well-described by a single exponential with time-constant \SI{4 \pm 1}{\pico\second}. However, reflections parallel to $\vect{c}^\star$ have a biexponential character the with time-constants \SI{400 \pm 100}{\femto\second} and \SI{4 \pm 1}{\pico\second}. Error bars represent the fluctuations before photoexcitation ($\tau < 0$) but are too small to see."}
```

The overall Bragg peak profiles were modified in one important way: a photoinduced amplitude change was measured, attributable to the transient Debye-Waller effect. In-plane reflections can be separated into two categories: the reflections which are nearly parallel to the $\vect{c}^\star$ axis, and the reflections which are not. For the reflections which are within $\sim\ang{45}$ degrees of the $\vect{c}^\star$ axis, the amplitude of the Bragg peak follows a Debye-Waller suppression with two time-constants \SI{400 \pm 100}{\femto\second} and \SI{4 \pm 1}{\pico\second}. For reflections which are not nearly parallel to $\vect{c}^\star$, only the slower time-constant is present. @fig:snse-dwaller shows the comparison between the amplitude suppression for reflections which are exactly parallel to $\vect{b}^\star$ ($\set{ (020), (040), ...}$) and reflections which are exactly parallel to $\vect{c}^\star$ ($\set{ (002), (004), ...}$). 

Recall from @eq:scattering-debye-waller that the Debye-Waller factor reports on the average mean-square-displacement of atoms $\langle |\vect{u}|^2 \rangle$ along the direction of the scattering vector $\vect{q}$. The fact that there is a fast component of the transient Debye-Waller dynamics in Bragg peaks nearly parallel to $\vect{c}^\star$ indicates that the mean-square-displacement of atoms along the $c$ axis -- i.e. the $Pnma$ lattice distortion -- is particularly affected by photoexcitation. The increase in mean-square-displacement should be reflected in the diffuse intensity across the Brillouin zone, which is presented next.

### Large-wavevector phonons

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-highsym file="figures/snse/highsym.py" caption="Comparison of the diffuse intensity dynamics at various in-plane high-symmetry points. The fit to the average across the entire Brillouin zone where $|\vect{k}| > \SI{0.285}{\per\angstrom}$ is shown as a dashed black trace for reference."}
```

The slow dynamics (\SI{4 \pm 1}{\pico\second}) in the Debye-Waller dynamics are correlated with the uniform rise of diffuse intensity away from zone-center. @fig:snse-highsym shows the differential intensity changes at three high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone: $Y$, $Z$, and $T$. See @fig:snse-bz for the geometry of the in-plane section of the Brillouin zone. The diffuse intensity from the Brillouin zone near multiple reflection was averaged to increase signal-to-noise. The three in-plane points show the exact same dependence: a single exponential rise with time-constant $\SI{3.6 \pm 0.6}{\pico\second}$. For reference, the average across the Brillouin zone away from the zone-center ($|\vect{k}| > \SI{0.285}{\per\angstrom}$) is shown.

### Small wavevectors phonons{#sec:snse-small-wavevectors}

The rapid increase in mean-square-displacement following excitation is not due to large wavevector phonons, as this rapid increase is not seen in the diffuse intensity away from zone-center. Recall that the $Pnma \to Cmcm$ phase transition involves the softening of many zone-center transverse optical modes polarized in the direction of the lattice distortion. 

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-diffuse-direction file="figures/snse/diffuse-direction.py" caption="Comparison of the differential intensity dynamics near reflections that are either almost parallel to $\vect{b}^\star$ or $\vect{c}^\star$. Near reflections almost parallel to $\vect{c}^\star$ (e.g. $(004)$, $(01\bar{7})$, etc.), a fast initial rise in intensity is observed which is not measured close to reflections almost parallel to $\vect{b}^\star$ (e.g. $(040)$, $(051)$, etc.)"}
```

Diffuse intensity dynamics correlated with the fast part of the Debye-Waller dynamics are indeed observed near zone-center. The one-phonon structure factors are expected to be large for the transverse modes polarized in the $c$ direction near reflections that are almost parallel to the $\vect{c}^\star$ axis. @fig:snse-diffuse-direction shows the integration of the total scattering intensity in a *ring* around reflections that are either nearly parallel to $\vect{b}^\star$ or $\vect{c}^\star$. 

These signals will be isolated appropriately and discussed in the next section.

## Dynamics of $c$-polarized transverse modes

In this section, the initial findings presented in @sec:snse-small-wavevectors will be developed further. There are two tasks at hand: confirm that the dynamics at zone-center are due to diffuse scattering, and separate isolate this trace from the nearby Bragg peak dynamics.

### Confirmation of diffuse dynamics via multiple scattering

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-forbidden-location file="figures/snse/static-forbidden.py" caption="Location of reflections which are forbidden in the $Pnma$ phase. These reflections are visible due to double diffraction."}
```

The intensity dynamics shown in @fig:snse-diffuse-direction can be confirmed to be due to dynamics in the diffuse intensity by performing experiments on a thick sample. Note that the thicker SnSe sample prepared by ultramicrotome show some degree of double diffraction, in the form of *forbidden reflections*[@Fultz2013ForbiddenReflections]. The $Pnma$ space group has a non-zero structure factor (@eq:scattering-potential-crystal) for following in-plane reflections:
$$
    \set{ (0kl) \mid k + l \in 2\mathbb{Z} }
$$
where $2\mathbb{Z}$ is understood to be the set of even integers. Forbidden reflections present in the thicker SnSe samples are indicated in @fig:snse-forbidden-location. While double diffraction is visible, the cross-section of a scattering event composed of a diffraction and diffuse scattering event is much less likely (see @sec:scattering-multiple). A comparison of the differential intensity dynamics near allowed and forbidden reflections is shown in @fig:snse-forbidden. For both allowed and forbidden reflections, only those which are roughly parallel to the $\vect{c}^\star$ axis were used. It is clear that the fast intensity increase is not present near the zone-center of reflections which result from double diffraction, which confirms that the ultrafast rise in intensity initially shown in @sec:snse-small-wavevectors is diffuse in nature.

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-forbidden file="figures/snse/forbidden.py" caption="Differential intensity dynamics in a ring near the Bragg peak of allowed and forbidden reflections. See @sec:snse-regions for a discussion on the geometry of the integration region."}
```

### Partitioning of the Brillouin zone{#sec:snse-regions}

The Bragg peak is fit with a Voigt profile (solid black line) with a full-width at half-max of \SI{0.158}{\per\angstrom}."}
```

In order to be more quantitative about the diffuse intensity dynamics at zone center, the intensity dynamics of the Bragg peaks need to be removed. Directly on the Bragg peaks, the absolute intensity change observed in @fig:snse-dwaller is 10^5^ times larger than the diffuse rise observed in @fig:snse-diffuse-direction. The transient Debye-Waller effect suppresses diffracted intensity, but does not change the peak profile. Therefore, there must be a region in reciprocal space -- far enough away from the peak location -- where the absolute change in peak intensity due to the transient Debye-Waller effect is on the same order as the diffuse rise.

By looking in a *ring* around Bragg peaks, the intensity dynamics can be separated between Debye-Waller (inner disk) and diffuse intensity near zone-center (outer torus) parametrized by:
\begin{align}
    \Omega_{\text{region 1}} &= \left\{ \vect{k} \mid |\vect{k}| < r \right\} \\
    \Omega_{\text{region 2}} &= \left\{ \vect{k} \mid r \leq |\vect{k}| \leq 2 r \right\} \label{eq:snse-region-2}\\
    \Omega_{\text{region 3}} &= \left\{ \vect{k} \mid 2 r < |\vect{k}| \right\}
\end{align}
The amplitude of the diffuse rise at zone-center is affected by the parameter $r$, but the time-constants are not. @fig:snse-size-comparison shows the intensity dynamics when integrating in region 2, for various parameters of $r$. In all cases, the differential intensity dynamics are well-described by a biexponential function. The relative amplitudes of the two exponentials determines the overall shape of the curves, as all the time-constants are comparable. The fitting results are summarized in @tbl:snse-size-comparison. The optimal sizes of the inner and outer radii, as defined by the dimensions which maximize the amplitude of the diffuse rise has $r = \SI{0.114}{\per\angstrom}$; this geometry is shown in @fig:snse-geometry. Region 1 and 2 are fairly small, considering that the in-plane Brillouin zone is \SI{1.49 x 1.41}{\per\angstrom} in size.

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-size-comparison file="figures/snse/size-comparison.py" caption="Comparison of intensity dynamics integrated in a region defined by @eq:snse-region-2 for multiple values of $r$.

\end{table}


With the appropriate partitioning of the Brillouin zone (@fig:snse-geometry), it is possible to separate the dynamics of the Bragg peak from the diffuse intensity at zone-center. The diffuse dynamics at zone-center presented in the previous section are definitely affected to some degree by the dynamics of the nearby Bragg peak. However, because it has been shown that the Bragg peak profiles are constant, the Debye-Waller dynamics from region 1 can be subtracted. The results are presented in @fig:snse-clean-traces. Most importantly, this reveals that the slow diffuse intensity decrease near zone-center is *not due* to the nearby Bragg peak, but is rather intrinsic to the diffuse dynamics.

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-clean-traces file="figures/snse/clean-traces.py" caption="Transient ultrafast electron scattering intensity at various points in the Brillouin zone.

Error bars represent the standard error in the mean of intensity before time-zero, but are generally smaller than the markers."}

### Transient mean-square-displacement due to soft-modes

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-displacement-fluence file="figures/snse/displacement.py" caption="Increase in mean-square-displacement of all atoms $\Delta \langle u^2 \rangle$, due to the change in vibrational amplitude of the zone-center $c$-polarized transverse modes exclusively. Boxes are used to represent error bars along both axes. Color bar shows associated photocarrier density $N_{\gamma}$."}
```

The fast component of the transient Debye-Waller dynamics (@fig:snse-dwaller) can be used to infer the change in vibrational amplitudes due exclusively to the modes at zone-center. The time-resolved suppression of Bragg intensity due to atomic vibrations is given by the following expression (@eq:scattering-diffracted-intensity-finite-temp):
\begin{align}
    \frac{I_0(\vect{q},\tau) - I_0(\vect{q},0)}{I_0(\vect{q},0)} 
        &\equiv \Delta I_0(\vect{q},\tau) \nonumber \\
        &= \frac{e^{-2M(\vect{q},\tau)} - e^{-2M(\vect{q},0)}}{e^{-2M(\vect{q},0)}} \nonumber \\
        &=e^{-2[M(\vect{q},\tau) - M(\vect{q},0)]} - 1
\end{align}
Rearranging terms:
$$
    - \frac{1}{2} \ln \left[1 + \Delta I_0(\vect{q},t) \right] = M(\vect{q}, \tau) - M(\vect{q}, 0)
$$
In this formulation, $M$ is the appropriate average of all atom-specific $W_s$ suppression factors from @eq:scattering-debye-waller [@Warren1990DebyeWaller]. There is no general expression for the quantity $M$ for diatomic crystals such as SnSe[@Warren1990DebyeWaller]. 
The fast component of the transient Debye-Waller dynamics are only visible for reflections nearly parallel to $\vect{c}^\star$, which informs on the atomic displacement in the $c$ direction. The harmonic approximation can be used, which states that if atoms are vibrating in a harmonic potential[@Warren1990Harmonic], the Debye-Waller factor $M$ is given by:
$$
    M(\vect{q}, \tau) = \frac{1}{2} |\vect{q}|^2 \langle |\bar{\vect{u}} \cdot \vect{e}_3|^2 \rangle
$$
where the symbol $\bar{\vect{u}}$ signifies the atomic displacement averaged over the atoms in the unit cell, and $\vect{e}_3$ is the unit vector in the $c$ direction. Then, the transient mean-square-displacement in the $c$ direction, $\Delta \langle |\bar{\vect{u}} \cdot \vect{e}_3|^2 \rangle \equiv \Delta \langle u_c^2 \rangle$, is related to the Bragg intensity at zone center as:
$$
    \Delta \langle u_c^2 \rangle = -\frac{\ln \left[1 + \Delta I_0(\vect{q},t) \right]}{|\vect{q}|^2}
$$
for $\vect{q}$ nearly parallel to $\vect{c}^\star$. The associated error $\sigma_u$ as a function of the pre-photoexcitation transient intensity error $\sigma_I$ is given by[@Bevington2003error]:
$$
    \sigma_u = \left| \frac{\partial \Delta \langle u_c^2 \rangle}{\partial I}\right|  \sigma_I = \frac{-\sigma_I}{|\vect{q}|^2 \left[1 + \Delta I_0(\vect{q},t) \right]}
$$
The extracted change in atomic displacement along the $c$ axis due to $c$-polarized transverse modes at zone-center as a function of fluence is shown in @fig:snse-displacement-fluence.  

#### Comparison with photocarrier density

It is instructive to compare the fluence-dependence of the vibrational amplitude in @fig:snse-displacement-fluence with photocarrier density generated in the sample. The total energy deposited for a particular fluence $f$, $E(f)$, is given by
$$
	E(f) = (1-R) \eta f \left( 1 - e^{-\frac{t}{\delta}}\right)
$$
where $R=0.54$ is the reflectivity at \SI{1.55}{\electronvolt}[@Makinistian2009], $\eta=0.27$ is the internal quantum efficiency[^qe], $t$ is the sample thickness, $\delta=\SI{100}{\nano\meter}$ is the penetration depth at \SI{1.55}{\electronvolt}[@Makinistian2009;@Barrios2014], and $A$ is the sample area. For reference, roughly 17% of the light is absorbed by a sample with thickness of \SI{45}{\nano\meter}. Assuming that the efficiency of generating charge carriers from photo absorption is 100%, the photocarrier density $N_{\gamma}$ is given by $E(f) / V / \SI{1.55}{\electronvolt}$, where $V$ is the sample volume. The relationship between fluence and $N_{\gamma}$ is shown in @fig:snse-photodoping for a \SI{50 x 50 x 0.045}{\micro\meter} sample.

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-photodoping file="figures/snse/photodoping.py" caption="Photocarrier density generated in SnSe for \SI{800}{\nano\meter} pump fluences on a \SI{50 x 50 x 0.045}{\micro\meter} sample. The lower and upper limits are shown as grey dashed lines, based on the uncertainty of \SI{\pm 5}{\nano\meter} in the thickness of the sample."}
```

## Discussion

In this section, the link between the observations presented previously and the origin of SnSe's high thermoelectric performance are discussed.

Consider first the ultrafast diffuse increase at zone-center. Recall the definition for the diffuse intensity (@eq:scattering-diffuse-intensity):
$$
    I_1(\vect{q}) \propto \sum_{\lambda} \frac{n_{\lambda}(\vect{k}) + 1/2}{\omega_{\lambda}(\vect{k})} |F_{1\lambda}(\vect{q})|^2
$$
This equation implies an increase of diffuse intensity is due to an increase in $(n_{\lambda}+1/2) / \omega_{\lambda}$ for one or more modes. Two potential causes of a rise are identified:

1. Selective mode-heating ($\uparrow n_{\lambda}$). Phonon modes may be populated selectively as the electronic system thermalizes. This is similar to the physics that was described in @sec:graphite.
2. Frequency renormalization ($\downarrow \omega_{\lambda}$). There are multiple zone-center phonon modes polarized in the $c$ direction which are known to soften towards the phase transition. The opposite has been observed by the author in TiSe$_2$ in Otto *et al.*[@Otto2021], where the photodoping of carriers selectively stiffened a soft zone-boundary phonon.

In analogy to @eq:scattering-displacement, terms of the form $n_{\lambda} + 1/2 / \omega_{\lambda}$ are directly proportional to vibrational amplitude. In this formulation, the fast diffuse intensity rise at $\Gamma$ is due to an increase in vibrational amplitude of one or more phonon modes polarized in the direction of the $Pnma$ lattice distortion. 

### Electron-phonon coupling and phonon renormalization

Given that the energy contained in pump pulses are absorbed by electrons, and that ultrafast electron scattering measures the subsequent lattice response, it is natural to ask how electron-phonon coupling can explain the experiments. The electron-phonon scattering rate $1/ \tau_{\lambda\vect{k}_p, epc}$, or rate of energy transfer between electrons at all wavevectors and phonons at wavevector $\vect{k}_p$, is given by[@Fan2018]:
$$
   1/ \tau_{\lambda\vect{k}_p, epc} = -\frac{2 \pi}{\hbar} \text{Im}\left[ \Sigma_{\lambda}(\vect{k}_p) \right]
$${#eq:snse-ep-scattering-rate}
where $a$ and $b$ label electron bands, $\vect{k}_e$ ($\vect{k}_p$) is the electronic (phonon) wavevector, and $\Sigma_{\lambda}(\vect{k}_p)$ is the self-energy for the phonon with quantum numbers $(\lambda, \vect{k}_p)$. The phonon self-energy also defines how vibrational frequencies are renormalized from $\omega^0_{\lambda}$ to $\omega_{\lambda}$ due to electron-phonon interactions[@Ando2006]: 
$$
    \frac{\omega_{\lambda}(\vect{k}_p)^2}{\omega^0_{\lambda}(\vect{k}_p)^2} - 1 = \frac{2}{\hbar \omega_0} \text{Re} \left[ \Sigma_{\lambda}(\vect{k}_p)\right]
$${#eq:snse-ep-renormalization}
The renormalization of phonon vibrational frequencies due to strong electron-phonon coupling was encountered in @sec:graphite-phonon-landscape in the form of Kohn anomalies[@Kohn1959].

Both a large electron-phonon scattering rate (i.e. selective mode-heating) and phonon frequency renormalization leads to the increased vibrational amplitude measured in SnSe ((@eq:scattering-displacement). Regardless of the physical cause of the increased vibrational amplitude (mode-heating or phonon renormalization), the consequences boil down to an ultrafast modification of the phonon self-energy. Computing the phonon self-energy for particular situations is arduous[@Mahan2000SelfEnergy;@Giustino2017], but in the Migdal approximation[@Migdal1958;@Noffsinger2010]: 
$$
    \Sigma_{\lambda}(\vect{k}_p) = 
        \sum_{a, b} \int \frac{d\vect{k}_e}{(2\pi)^3} ~ | g^{\lambda}_{ab}(\vect{k}_p, \vect{k}_e) |^2 ~ \frac{f\left[\epsilon_{a}(\vect{k}_e)\right] - f\left[\epsilon_b(\vect{k}_e + \vect{k}_p)\right]}{\epsilon_a(\vect{k}_e) - \epsilon_b(\vect{k}_e + \vect{k}_p) - \hbar \omega_{\lambda}(\vect{k}_p) + i\eta}
$${#eq:snse-phonon-self-energy}
where $a$ and $b$ label electron bands, $\vect{k}_e$ ($\vect{k}_p$) is the electronic (phonon) wavevector, $f(\epsilon)$ is the electronic energy distribution (which might be non-thermal), and $\eta$ is an infinitesimally-small number. The electron-phonon coupling vertex, $g^{\lambda}_{ab}(\vect{k}_e, \vect{k}_p)$, describes the rate of inelastic single electron scattering between bands $a$ and $b$ through the creation or annihilation of a phonon with quantum numbers $(\lambda, \vect{k}_p)$. The electron-phonon coupling vertex $g$ was encountered in @sec:introduction-epc and @sec:graphite-coupling-constants.

The electron-phonon scattering rate (@eq:snse-ep-scattering-rate) and phonon renormalization (@eq:snse-ep-renormalization) are therefore proportional to the $\vect{k}_e$-integrated electron-phonon coupling vertex via @eq:snse-phonon-self-energy. Photoexcitation perturbs the electronic energy distribution ($f$), and this non-thermal energy distribution will scatter to phonons $(\lambda, \vect{k}_p)$ based on the strength of $g$. Therefore, whether the diffuse intensity rise at zone-center is due to selective mode heating, phonon renormalization, or both, is not an important distinction. The diffuse intensity rise at zone-center can be associated with strong electron-phonon coupling to zone-center modes polarized in the $c$ direction and at least an order-of-magnitude lower coupling everywhere else in the plane.

This is not entirely unexpected. Calculations by Ma *et al.*[@Ma2018] have revealed that the mobility of electrons and holes is strongly-modified at zone-center due to polar optical modes. Calculations by Caruso *et al.*[@Caruso2019] have reported strong electron-phonon coupling to zone-center optical modes polarized in the $c$ direction, most importantly the $B_u$ (\SI{8}{\milli\electronvolt}) and the $B_g$ (\SI{20}{\milli\electronvolt}) modes. The results presented in this chapter corroborate these findings, at least qualitatively. 

### Initial intravalley scattering

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-intravalley file="figures/snse/intravalley.py" caption="In-plane carrier relaxation process in the first picosecond. Color intensity represents the photoelectron and photohole densities $N_{e^{-}}$ and $N_{h^{+}}$ respectively, where white is zero. The contours represent the dispersion of @fig:snse-electronic-structure. **a)** Carrier densities just after photoexcitation. **b)** Carrier densities after $\sim\SI{1}{\pico\second}$ showing that carriers have undergone intravalley scattering mediated by small wavevector phonons (arrows) to the local extrema of the conduction and valence bands."}
```

The relaxation mechanism which is compatible with the ultrafast electron scattering measurements in the first picosecond is intravalley charge-carrier scattering[@Sjakste2018]. Electrons undergo vertical transitions when absorbing \SI{1.55}{\electronvolt} photons. Given that the direct, optical band gap of SnSe is less than the photon energy at \SI{1.3}{\electronvolt}[@Shi2018], the electrons have some excess energy above the local conduction band minimum. There are multiple local conduction band minima which could accept vertical transitions at \SI{1.55}{\electronvolt}: $\Gamma$, $\frac{2}{3} Z$, $P$ (out-of-plane), and the global minimum $\frac{2}{3} Y$[@Cuong2015;@Wei2019]. The electrons first scatter with zone-center strongly-coupled phonons, which thermalizes both subsystems together. This is called *intravalley scattering*, as the electrons are losing energy towards the local band minimum. This is possible because this initial fast scattering ($<$\SI{300}{\femto\second}) involves small wavevectors due to the electrons' proximity to the local conduction minimum, and it is fast because of the strength of the coupling discussed in the previous section. The process is represented in @fig:snse-intravalley. 

### Large-wavevector relaxation dynamics

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-relaxation-amplitude file="figures/snse/relaxation-bz.py" caption="Relative diffuse intensity change at \SI{5}{\pico\second} shows no structure representative of anharmonic decay of zone-center modes."}
```

The experimental results show a relaxation of the intensity at zone-center after the initial fast rise described in the previous section, which is correlated to the rise of diffuse intensity across the Brillouin zone (\SI{3.5}{\pico\second}). The energy stored in the strongly-coupled modes at zone-center can relax in two ways: anharmonic decay or electron intervalley scattering

The anharmonic decay relaxation mechanism sees one zone-center phonon generate two lower energy phonons in a process that conserves energy and momentum. There are reveral reports on the strong bonding anharmonicity in SnSe[@Zhao2014;@Li2015;@Zhao2016a;@Hong2019;@Lanigan2020]. However, the phonon lifetimes are estimated to be longer (\SIrange{15}{30}{\pico\second})[@Chandrasekhar1977;@Li2015;@Lanigan2020] than what has been observed via ultrafast electron scattering (\SI{3.5}{\pico\second}). The results presented here are *not compatible* with an anharmonic decay picture for a different reason: the lack of structure in the diffuse intensity dynamics. The measurements in graphite (@sec:graphite) have shown that the anharmonic decay of phonons measured in the time-domain is highly representative of the phonon dispersion due to energy- and momentum-conservation rules. However, the diffuse rise in intensity away from zone-center is completely uniform. This is shown in @fig:snse-relaxation-amplitude, where the average relative diffuse intensity increase at \SI{5}{\pico\second} shows no structure beyond the partitioning of the Brillouin zone described in @sec:snse-regions. Most importantly, the diffuse rise everywhere is found to happen with the same characteristic time-scale (@fig:snse-highsym).

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-intervalley-sim file="figures/snse/intervalley.py" caption="Relative number of allowed relaxation pathways after initial intravalley scattering of charge-carriers. Regions in white represent relaxation pathways that are forbidden, no matter the initial distribution of hot charge carriers. **a)** Relative number of relaxation pathways for electrons. **b)** Relative number of relaxation pathways for holes."}
```

Similarly, the isotropic slow rise of diffuse intensity for large wavevectors is incompatible with *intervalley scattering*, whereby electrons and holes relax from the local band edge to the global band edge by emitting large wavevector phonons[@Sjakste2018]. To understand why, the allowed intervalley relaxation pathways were simulated for electrons and holes; the following explanation focuses on electrons for simplicity. Consider $E(\vect{k})$ to be the in-plane electronic dispersion in reciprocal space. An initial electron density-of-states $g^i_{e^{-}}(\epsilon)$ around local band minima is assumed as shown in @fig:snse-intravalley b). Electrons with energy $\epsilon$ can only relax to locations in reciprocal space where the dispersion is lower in energy. This constraint can be expressed using the Heaviside step function $\Theta$, where $\Theta\left\{-g^i_{e^{-}}(\epsilon)\right\}$ is unity for $\epsilon < g^i_{e^{-}}(\epsilon)$ and zero otherwise. The number of allowed relaxation pathways $P_{e^{-}}(\vect{k})$ in reciprocal space are therefore given by the cross-correlation between the initial electron density $g^i_{e^{-}}(\epsilon) E(\vect{k})$ and the allowed relaxation pathways $\Theta\left\{-g^i_{e^{-}}(\epsilon)\right\} E(\vect{k})$: 
$$
    P_{e^{-}}(\vect{k}) \propto \int_{0}^{\infty} d\epsilon \left[ g^i_{e^{-}}(\epsilon) E(\vect{k}) \right] \star \left[ \Theta\left\{-g^i_{e^{-}}(\epsilon)\right\} E(\vect{k}) \right]
$$
where $\star$ is the cross-correlation operation with symmetric boundary conditions, which accounts for scattering to other Brillouin zones (Umklapp scattering). The proportionality constant is chosen so that $P_{e^{-}}(\vect{k}) \leq 1$. Similarly, holes scatter up in energy so that:
$$
    P_{h^{+}}(\vect{k}) \propto \int_{0}^{\infty} d\epsilon \left[ g^i_{h^{+}}(\epsilon) E(\vect{k}) \right] \star \left[ \Theta\left\{g^i_{h^{+}}(\epsilon)\right\} E(\vect{k}) \right]
$$
where $g^i_{h^{+}}(\epsilon)$ is the initial holes density-of-states as shown in @fig:snse-intravalley b). The results of these calculations are shown in @fig:snse-intervalley-sim. While these calculations are sensitive to the initial density-of-states, note that there are still many regions in reciprocal space where relaxation is forbidden regardless of the initial conditions (i.e. $P_{e^{-}}(\vect{k})$ and $P_{h^{+}}(\vect{k})$ are zero). It follows that intervalley scattering of charge-carriers does not explain the isotropic rise in diffuse intensity on a \SI{3.5}{\pico\second} time-scale.

### Phase transition mechanism

The ultrafast electron scattering measurements and the discussion of the previous sections demonstrates that strong electron-phonon coupling to one or more $c$-polarized zone-center phonons is very strong. Calculations by Caruso *et al.*[@Caruso2019] suggest that electron-phonon interactions are strongest with the optical modes linked to the $Pnma \to Cmcm$ phase transition. In second-order, displacive phase transitions like the $Pnma \to Cmcm$ transition, the frequency of the soft phonon mode which freezes at the transition temperature $T_c$ can be used as an order parameter[@Dove1997]. This kind of Landau theory description is phenomenological in nature, and so there is no unified driving mechanism behind such phase transitions. In this regard, the measurements presented in this chapter can be identified as a *destabilization* of the $Pnma$ phase with photocarriers. The dependence of the destabilization with fluence (@fig:snse-photodoping) reinforces the idea that the thermal phase transition is driven by electron-phonon interactions, because the thermal carrier-density naturally increases with temperature.

```{.matplotlib #fig:snse-z file="figures/snse/z.py" caption="Thermoelectric figure-of-merit where the effect of temperature has been factored out. This figure shows that the $Cmcm$ phase is an intrinsically-better thermoelectric than tin selenide in the $Pnma$."}
```

The identification of the transition to the $Cmcm$ phase as a consequence of strong and anisotropic electron-phonon interactions is important because the thermoelectric performance of tin selenide is maximized in the $Cmcm$ phase. Recall that by the definition of thermoelectric figure-of-merit from @eq:snse-zt, the thermoelectric conversion efficiency is higher for higher temperatures. However, the $Cmcm$ phase is a better thermoelectric even when factoring out the effect of temperature[@Telkes1947], as shown in @fig:snse-z.

The $Cmcm$ phase is the better thermoelectric because the Seebeck coefficient $S$ does not significantly drop at higher temperatures, and that the thermal conductivity remains low[@Zhao2014;@Wei2019]; the temperature-dependence of these quantities is shown in @fig:snse-performance, reproduced from Zhao *et al.*[@Zhao2014]

### Ultralow thermal conductivity and the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit

There is not enough information to rule out that acoustic modes may also be strongly-coupled to the electrons at zone center. In this section, the consequences of this hypothetical situation are considered. Acoustic branches are responsible for most of the thermal transport at equilibrium, due to their high group velocity[@Cahill2003]. Therefore, strong electron-phonon coupling at zone-center may be responsible for the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity in tin selenide. 

The reduction of lattice thermal conductivity due to strong electron-phonon interactions at zone-center have been studied theoretically in silicon by Liao *et al.*[@Liao2015] It was found that at high carrier concentrations ($>$ 10^19^ \si{\per\cubic\centi\meter}), the overall lattice thermal conductivity was reduced by as much as 45\%. Moreover, the scattering rate of phonons was dominated by electron-phonon interactions for low-energy phonon modes, and not (anharmonic) phonon-phonon interactions. Something similar was calculated in silicon germanium by Fan *et al.*[@Fan2018] These ideas were tested experimentally in crystalline silicon membranes by Zhou *et al.*[@Zhou2020] using transient thermal grating diffraction. These experiments showed that at room temperature, the thermal transport was indeed strongly affected by electron-phonon interactions when carrier concentration was increased via ultrafast photoexcitation above 10^19^ \si{\per\cubic\centi\meter}.

If strong electron-phonon coupling to acoustic modes were also at play in tin selenide, the consensus today about the low lattice thermal conductivity $\kappa_l$ being suppressed by anharmonic interactions would need to be recontextualized. The case for anharmonic phonon-phonon scattering is made in one of two ways. First, the thermal lattice expansion is a measure of anharmonicity through the *Grüneisen* parameter[@Gruneisen1912]. Calculations suggest that anharmonicity along all crystal axes is strong, and strongest along the stacking axis $a$[@Zhao2014]. However, the $ZT$ figure-of-merit remains low along the $a$ axis because the electrical conductivity is also low in this direction[@Zhao2014]. Calculations by Li *et al.*[@Li2015] could only reproduce the low lattice thermal conductivity when taking into account long-range bonding anharmonicity, although these results fail to reproduce the Grüneisen parameter calculations of Zhao *et al.*[@Zhao2014] The explicit contribution of electron-phonon coupling to SnSe's ultralow thermal conductivity has not been addressed to date.

The behavior of $\kappa$ with increasing temperature exhibits an asymptotic behavior above \SI{600}{\kelvin} which is reminiscent of the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit on the resistivity in so-called "bad metals" [@Ioffe1960;@Mott1974;@Gurvitch1981]. The Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit expresses that the transport properties of quasiparticles saturate once their mean-free-path has fallen below the lattice dimensions[@Zhang2019]. Our measurements suggest that the phonon mean-free-path in SnSe might be close to the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit above \SI{600}{\kelvin} due to strong electron-phonon coupling. This happens at equilibrium due to the thermal enhancement of the electron-phonon scattering rate (@eq:snse-ep-scattering-rate), and ultrafast electron diffuse scattering reveals a similar behavior via impulsive photodoping. 

### Polaronic strain field

Caruso *et al*.[@Caruso2019] suggest that in SnSe, the phonon modes which are the most coupled to the conduction electrons are zone-center optical polar modes polarized along the $c$ axis. The dressing of charge-carriers by polar phonons -- known as polarons -- have been the subject of much research [@Frohlich1950;@Feynman1955].

## Conclusion

In this chapter, combined ultrafast electron diffraction and diffuse scattering measurements on photodoped SnSe were presented. The measurements showed strong electron-phonon coupling to zone-center phonon modes polarized along the lattice distortion of the low-temperature $Pnma$ phase, and uniformly-weaker electron-phonon coupling everywhere else. Anharmonic coupling between zone-center modes and modes away from $\Gamma$ was found to be less important than electron-phonon coupling, contrary to most calculations and assumptions made in the literature. These results reveal that strong, anisotropic electron-phonon coupling may play a large role in SnSe's ultralow thermal conductivity and the $Pnma \to Cmcm$ phase transition. These findings recontextualize a lot of previous calculations and measurements on high-performance intrinsic thermoelectrics.  

### Outlook

There are multiple natural extensions of the research presented in this chapter. Do the phonon dynamics change near \SI{600}{\kelvin}, where the conduction band minimum changes? Can photoexcitation drive the material into a metastable $Cmcm$-like phase with impulsive photodoping? Performing similar ultrafast electron diffuse scattering experiments at higher temperatures would answer these questions. Another important avenue to explore is study high-quality, fully-dense crystals. The crystals used here are the exact same used in Zhao *et al*[@Zhao2014], which have been criticized for not being fully-dense[@Wei2016] (\SI{5.43}{\gram\per\cubic\centi\meter} vs. \SI{6.13}{\gram\per\cubic\centi\meter}). This discrepancy in densities brings a drop in DC electrical conductivity by a factor of 10[@Zhao2014;@Wei2019]. Using high-quality, low-defect samples will enable the simultaneous application of ultrafast electron diffuse scattering and time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy to fully-characterize the determinants of thermoelectricity following impulsive photodoping.

[^cuong]: The orbital make-up of the electronic bands is known thanks to work by Cuong *et al.*[@Cuong2015], but note that their lattice parameters swap the $b$ and $c$ axes compared to work by all other papers referenced in this chapter.
[^zt-fully-dense]: Work by Wei *et al.*[@Wei2019] has shown that in fully-dense SnSe single crystals, the maximum value for $ZT$ is reduced to $<1$ at \SI{800}{\kelvin}.
