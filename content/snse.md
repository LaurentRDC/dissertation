## Experimental methods

### Sample preparation

#### Ultramicrotomy

```{.matplotlib file="figures/snse/sample.py" caption="Stages of sample preparation via ultramicrotome. **a)** Prism of SnSe embedded in epoxy.  **b)** 4x magnification on the cut surface shown in a) shows large crystalline plateaus. **c)** Surface of embedded SnSe prism after trimming with a \ang{45} diamond knife. **d)** \SI{60}{\nano\meter} section of SnSe cut with a \ang{35} diamond knife."}
```

#### Mechanical exfoliation

```{.matplotlib file="figures/snse/diff-static.py" caption="Comparison of static diffraction patterns from samples prepared via two techniques. **a)** \SI{90}{\nano\meter}-thick sample prepared via ultramicrotome. **b)** \SI{30}{\nano\meter}-thick samples prepared via mechanical exfoliation."}

```{.matplotlib file="figures/snse/widths.py" caption="Dynamics of the width and position of various Bragg peaks following photoexcitation. For every time-delay, Bragg peaks were fit with a Gaussian function. In the right column, the change in full-width at half-maximum $\Delta \sigma$ is shown over time. In the left column, the absolute shift in the center position of the peak $\Delta x_c$ is shown, as a percentage of the average full-width at half-maximum $\bar{\sigma}$. For all plots, the error bars represent the covariance of fit parameter."}
```

### Diffuse scattering measurements

```{.matplotlib file="figures/snse/forbidden.py" caption="Comparison of the relative intensity change $\Delta I / I_0$ at $\Gamma$, for the integration geometry described in @fig:snse-diffuse. **a)** Diffuse intensity dynamics near reflections allowed by the $Pnma$ space group. **b)** Diffuse intensity dynamics near reflections that are forbidden by the $Pnma$ space group. These reflections probably arise from the double scattering of allowed reflections."}
