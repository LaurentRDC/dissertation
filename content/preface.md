# Preface {#sec:preface .unnumbered}

The author declares that the work presented in this thesis constitutes original scholarship and distinct contributions to the field of condensed matter physics.

The contribution of other members of the Siwick research group and collaborators to this thesis is described. 

The data exploration software package `iris` and its supporting libraries `crystals`, `npstreams`, and `scikit-ued`, have been conceptualized and realized by the author. The ultrafast electron diffractometer with which experiments were performed by the author was initially designed and built by Robert Chatelain and Vance Morisson, with significant advances in performance brought by Martin R. Otto. The data acquisition and reduction software that powers the instrument, `faraday`, was designed by the author. The ultrafast electron scattering experiments on graphite flakes were performed by Robert Chatelain, the density-functional perturbation theory calculations were conducted by Jan-Hendrick PÃ¶hls; the author was responsible for the graphite data analysis and conclusions (@sec:graphite). The ultrafast electron scattering experiments on tin selenide were performed and analyzed by the author, while the bulk crystals were synthesized by Z. Luo from Northwestern University (@sec:snse).
