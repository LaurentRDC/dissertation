The author declares that the work presented in this dissertation constitutes original scholarship and distinct contributions to the field of condensed matter physics.

The contribution of other members of the Siwick research group and collaborators to this dissertation is described. 

The ultrafast electron diffractometer with which experiments were performed by the author was initially designed and built by Robert Chatelain and Vance Morisson, with significant advances in performance brought by Martin R. Otto. The data acquisition and reduction software that powers the instrument was designed and realized by the author. The ultrafast electron scattering experiments on graphite were performed by Robert Chatelain. The density-functional perturbation theory calculations of the phonon vibrational frequencies and polarization vectors were conducted by Jan-Hendrick Pöhls. The author was responsible for the graphite data analysis and conclusions (@sec:graphite). The ultrafast electron scattering experiments on tin selenide were performed by the author, with help from Martin Otto, and the results were analyzed by the author. The bulk SnSe crystals were synthesized by Z. Luo from Northwestern University (@sec:snse).
