TODO: important differentiator for UEDS vs X-ray is the amount of redundancy. The redundancy leads to the ability to invert the energy-integrated nature of UEDS.

## Experimental methods

### Sample preparation

Single-crystal flakes of natural graphite \SIrange{10}{90}{\nano\meter} thick were prepared using a mechanical exfoliation procedure analogous to the work by Novoselov *et al* [@Novoselov2004], briefly described here. Thick flakes were embedded in Crystalbond glue on a \SI{3}{\milli\meter} copper TEM grid (200 lines per inch). The embedded flakes are then exfoliated using ordinary adhesive tape. The procedure was repeated until the embedded flakes were translucent when observed under an optical microscope. The glue is then delicately washed away with a solvent. The choice of the solvent is dependent on the glue used; in the present case, acetone was used. Sample thickness has been measured directly using atomic force microscopy characterization (see @fig:graphite-afm). Once a suitable sample has been identified, an aperture was made using aluminum foil to isolate a sample region with uniform thickness. The resulting sample used in this work covered 500 × 500 \si{\square\micro\meter}, with a thickness of \SI{70}{\nano\meter}.

### Data acquisition 

The UEDS experiments presented in this chapter made use of the experimental setup presented in @sec:experimental_setup. Ultrashort laser pulses of light  were shone at $t=t_0$ on a thin single-crystal specimen of graphite, oriented in the $\left[001\right]$ direction. Compressed electron bunches with 10^7^ electrons per bunch were transmitted through the sample at $t=t_0 + \tau$. The time-delay $\tau$ was scanned from \SI{-40}{\pico\second} to \SI{680}{\pico\second}.

The interrogated film were pumped with a pump spot of 1 × 1 \si{\square\milli\meter} full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), ensuring nearly uniform illumination of the probed volume. The film was pumped at a fluence of \SI{12}{\milli\J\per\square\centi\meter}, resulting in an absorbed energy density of \SI{8}{\J\per\meter\cube}. The scattering patterns are collected with a Gatan Ultrascan 895 camera: a \SI{1}{\square\inch} phosphor screen fiber coupled to a 2048 px × 2048 px charge-coupled detector (CCD) placed \SI{25}{\centi\meter} away from the sample. The experiment herein consists of time delays in the range of \SIrange{−40}{680}{\pico\second}. Per-pixel scattering intensity fluctuations over laboratory time reveals a transient dynamic range of 1 : 10^8^, allowing the acquisition of diffraction patterns and diffuse scattering patterns simultaneously. A static diffraction pattern is shown in @fig:graphite-static a).

Due to the flatness of the Ewald sphere for \SI{90}{\kilo\electronvolt} electrons, many symmetry-related reflections are visible within each pattern. The information contained in a set of symmetry-equivalent reflections is redundant due to the point-group symmetry of the scattering crystal. As long as the point-group symmetry is not broken by photoexcitation its consequences, it is possible to harness the redundancy to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of a UEDS dataset. In the case of graphite, no observable symmetry-breaking phenomena is brought on by photoexcitation at \SI{1.55}{\electronvolt} when looking at the raw data. Moreover, trARPES experiments [@Stange2015] do not show the opening of a gap in the electronic band structure, albeit at much lower photoexcitation densities, which would be indicative of point-group symmetry breaking. The point-group of graphite is $6/mmm$, which encompasses 6-fold discrete rotational symmetry in the $\vec{a} \times \vec{b}$ plane. Therefore, specifically in the case of graphite oriented in the $\left[ 001 \right]$ direction, we can safely enhance the diffuse signals by a factor of $\sqrt{6}$ by the use of a six-fold discrete azimuthal average:
$$
    I(\vec{q}, \tau) \to \frac{1}{6} \sum_{n=1}^6 I( \vec{R}(\tfrac{\pi n}{3}) \cdot \vec{q}, \tau)
$$
where $\vec{R}(\theta)$ is the in-plane rotation matrix:
$$
    \vec{R}(\theta) = \begin{pmatrix}
                      \cos{\theta} & -\sin{\theta} & 0\\
                      \sin{\theta} & \cos{\theta}  & 0\\
                      0            & 0             & 1
                     \end{pmatrix}
$$
Throughout the rest of this chapter, "scattering intensity" will imply discrete azimuthal average unless otherwise noted. An example of six-fold averaged diffraction pattern is shown in @fig:graphite-static b).

## Diffuse intensity dynamics

The change in scattering intensity for representative time-delays is shown in

```{.python #fig:graphite-ueds .matplotlib caption="Change in scattering intensity $\Delta I(\vec{q}, t=\tau) = I(\vec{q}, \tau) - I(\vec{q}, -\infty)$ of photoexcited graphite for a few representative time-delays $\tau$. Hexagonal Brillouin zones are shown on half of the reflections to guide the eye. Scattering patterns show diffuse dynamics in the range of $|\vec{q}| < \SI{12}{\per\angstrom}$. Negative going features (blue) are exclusively due to the transient Debye-Waller effect on the Bragg peaks. All positive changes (red) are dynamics of the diffuse scattering intensity."}
