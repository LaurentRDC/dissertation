TODO: what else to talk about

Ultrafast electron diffuse scattering was the star of this dissertation. It was motivated in @sec:introduction as a way to get at a nearly-inaccessible facet of the impulse response of quantum systems. The theory of ultrafast diffuse scattering was developed in @sec:scattering. It showed that the transient Debye-Waller effect -- often measured in ultrafast electron diffraction -- is intricately linked with diffuse scattering. In @sec:graphite, the perfect benchmark system was studied with an eye for the particular strengths and limitations of diffuse scattering measurements. Those measurements were used to sidestep the ideas of the two-temperature model. Finally, in @sec:snse, ultrafast electron diffraction and diffuse scattering were used in conjunction to elucidate the mystery of thermoelectric performance in one of the best intrinsic thermoelectrics, SnSe. Strong electron-phonon coupling at zone-center suggested that strong carrier-lattice interactions are viable tuning parameters in the optimization of intrinsic thermoelectric performance. 

The last chapter on SnSe is a taste of things to come; the future is bright for ultrafast electron scattering. Following fantastic improvements in electron compression stability, \SI{50}{\femto\second} time-resolution is not far. As new laboratories are built with more stable laser oscillators, further improvements in performance are to be expected, to the point where the observation of direct phonon emission might be realistic. 

The author hopes that in the next 5-10 years, ultrafast electron scattering hardware will be commoditized, at which point it will become a standard tool in the study of low-dimensional materials. Given the unique ability to resolve lattice dynamics across the Brillouin zone, ultrafast electron diffuse scattering is poised to democratize the experimental access to strongly-coupled systems and revolutionize our understanding of strong interactions in functional materials.
