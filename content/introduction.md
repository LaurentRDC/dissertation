# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

The fields of condensed matter physics and material science tackle a variety of intertwined questions, from fundamental physics to concrete applications.  Given that condensed matter systems are complex, many experimental dimensions are used to distinguish between phenomena. Electron microscopy comes to mind as an example of a technique which can selectively observe physical systems in real-space (via imaging) or in momentum (via diffraction).

In highly-ordered systems (i.e. crystals), where electronic correlation effects are most likely to matter, the time scales associated with fundamental actions are determined by the energy scale around room temperature. Phonons populated at room temperature (\SI{300}{\kelvin} = \SI{25}{\milli\electronvolt}) might have a period shorter than \SI{1}{\pico\second} ($10^{-12}$ \si{\second}).

## Ultrafast laser systems {#sec:laser_sources}

Digital measurement devices are generally limited to nanosecond resolution, and are therefore too slow to observe dynamics in the femtosecond range. Therefore, at the heart of most ultrafast experiment lies an ultrafast laser system. An ultrafast laser system consists of a pulsed source of highly-coherent radiation. 

Two things are required from the laser system: that its pulses be short, and that its pulses have high peak power. The length of laser pulses produced by such systems typically determine the time-resolution of experiments. The high peak power allows for the use of non-linear optical techniques, such as frequency-doubling.

Ultrafast laser systems like those used herein are composed of two optical assemblies. Ultrashort (\SI{<100}{\femto\second}) laser pulses are produced by a mode-locked laser system. These short pulses lack the high peak power, and are amplified via chirped pulse amplification. in a regenerative laser amplifier The resulting pulses are short (\SI{<100}{\femto\second}), while also reaching peak powers of up to \SI{1}{\peta\watt}.
