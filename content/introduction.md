# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

The fields of condensed matter physics and material science tackle a variety of intertwined questions, from fundamental physics to concrete applications.  Given that condensed matter systems are complex, many experimental dimensions are used to distinguish between phenomena. Electron microscopy comes to mind as an example of a technique which can selectively observe physical systems in real-space (via imaging) or in momentum (via diffraction).

In highly-ordered systems (i.e. crystals), where electronic correlation effects are most likely to matter, the time scales associated with fundamental actions are determined by the energy scale around room temperature. Phonons populated at room temperature (\SI{300}{\kelvin} = \SI{25}{\milli\electronvolt}) might have a period shorter than \SI{1}{\pico\second} ($10^{-12}$ \si{\second}).
