# Electron scattering

The scattering of light or particles by a sample is used by a large class of experimental techniques, dating back a hundred years. Scattering can be broadly defined as the modification of an incoming wave by a potential into outgoing wave, a process which imprints the outgoing wave with some characteristic of the potential. The outgoing wave may lose or gain energy, and its momentum might be changed. When multiple incoming waves are simultaneously used -- forming an incoming wavefront --, the outgoing waves may interfere constructively or destructively. This effect is particularly intense for periodic scattering potentials, for example in crystals.

This chapter will consider the special case of *electron scattering*. In crystals, electrons are scattered by the electrostatic potential due to their charge. The description of X-ray scattering, for example, would be identical provided that the total electron charge-density be considered as the scattering potential, instead of the electrostatic potential.

Specifically, the type of scattering relevant to this work involves the probing of periodic structures, crystals. Thanks to advances in data acquisition and data analysis attributable to the author (see [appendix @sec:appendix]), as well as improvements to instrument stability[@Otto2017], the ultrafast electron scattering instrument used herein can reliably measure the effects of *diffuse scattering*.


## Single-electron scattering in an arbitrary potential

Consider an electron wavefunction $\Psi(\vec{x}, t)$. The scattering of $\Psi(\vec{x}, t)$ by an arbitrary potential $V(\vec{r},t)$ is described by the Schrödinger equation:

$$
i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\vec{x}, t) = \left[ \frac{- \hbar^2}{2 m_e} \nabla^2 + V(\vec{r}, t) \right]\Psi(\vec{x}, t)
$${#eq:schroedinger}
