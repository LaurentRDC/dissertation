  I would like to thank everyone who has made this work possible. 
  
  I am most grateful to my doctoral advisor Bradley Siwick for his continuing support. Following the trail marked by his questions has led me 
  to be a better scientist. I am also indebted to my fellow research group members who have played a pivotal role in my research: Martin Otto, 
  Mark Stern, Jan-Hendrick Pöhls, Tristan Britt, and Syed Ali Hassan. Other members of the Center of Physics of Materials have also positively 
  influenced my research, most importantly Benjamin Dringoli and Dominique Matte.

  I am also grateful to faculty members David Cooke, Mark Sutton, and Patanjali Kambhampati for their advice and support throughout the years.

  The research presented in this dissertation would not have been possible without the support of many McGill employees. I would like to thank Jeannie Mui and S. Kelly Sears 
  from the McGill Facility for Electron Microscopy Research, Richard Rossi and Weihua Wang from the Chemistry department, and Jean-Philippe Guay and 
  John Smeros from the Physics department.

  Finally, I would like to thank the students in our shared office for their friendship and personal support: Dallas Strandell, Gabriela Romero Esquivel, Colin Sonnichsen, 
  Harry Baker, Hélène Seiler, Samuel Palato, Patrick Brosseau, Cameron Reid, and many others.
