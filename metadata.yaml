### really long titles may require (multiple) line break(s) in page headers when using Eisvogel
### activate (i.e. uncomment the next line) "header-left" to define a shortened single-line version of your long title to be used in page headers
#header-left: "Shortened version of title for running page headers ..."
### (note to myself: "header-left" is a meta-data variable in the Eisvogel template)

### activate (i.e. uncomment the next line) "headeralternative" to use chapter/section in header instead of title
