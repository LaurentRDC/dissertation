  Ultrafast electron diffraction with bunch compression has reached a level of 
  performance which allows for the accurate measurement of time-resolved diffuse 
  scattering with a time-resolution of 150 femtoseconds. This information 
  extends ultrafast electron diffraction to time- and momentum-resolved studies 
  of phonon systems (lattice waves) in single-crystal materials. In this 
  dissertation, time-resolved diffuse scattering is explored in two 
  low-dimensional materials. Time-resolved diffuse scattering is first explored 
  in graphite, where anisotropic electron-phonon coupling and stiff phonon bands 
  allow for maximum measurement contrast. The redundancy in ultrafast electron 
  scattering patterns, as well as crystal symmetry, are used to robustly recover 
  the occupancy of all in-plane phonon modes. The mode-, momentum- and 
  time-dependent phonon populations are determined, revealing the nonequilibrium 
  lattice states that follow photoexcitation and the complete breakdown of the 
  two-temperature model often used to describe these dynamics. The measurements 
  presented also provide a direct view of anharmonic decay pathways of phonons 
  across the Brillouin zone, and a technique to extract electron-phonon coupling 
  matrix elements from phonon population is developed. The lessons are then 
  applied to further our understanding of the best intrinsic thermoelectric 
  materials, tin selenide.  There, combined ultrafast electron diffraction 
  and diffuse scattering measurements elucidate the mystery of ultralow thermal 
  conductivity that gives tin selenide its high thermoelectric efficiency. It 
  is found that strong and anisotropic electron-phonon coupling dominates the 
  zone-center phonon dynamics, not anharmonic coupling as previously thought. 
  These findings recontextualize what was thought about the determinants of 
  thermoelectric performance, primarily the role of electron-phonon coupling
  in lowering thermal conductivity.
