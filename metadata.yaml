  Ultrafast electron diffraction with bunch compression has reached a level of performance which allows for the accurate measurement of 
  time-resolved diffuse scattering. This information extends ultrafast electron diffraction to the time-resolved study of lattice waves. 
  In this dissertation, time-resolved diffuse scattering is explored in two low-dimensional materials. Time-resolved diffuse scattering 
  is first explored in graphite, where anisotropic electron-phonon couplign and stiff phonon bands allow for maximum measurement contrast. 
  The redundancy in ultrafast electron scattering patterns, as well as crystal symmetry, are used to robustly recover energy resolution. 
  The mode-, momentum- and time-dependent phonon populations are determined, eschewing the concept of lattice temperature. These measurements 
  provide a direct view of anharmonic decay pathways of phonons across the Brillouin zone. It is shown how to extract electron-phonon coupling 
  matrix elements across the Brillouin zone from phonon population. The lessons are then applied to one of the best intrinsic thermoelectric 
  materials, tin selenide.  There, combined ultrafast electron diffraction and diffuse scattering measurements elucidate the mystery of 
  ultralow thermal conductivity that gives tin selenide its high thermoelectric efficiency. It is found that strong and anisotropic 
  electron-phonon coupling dominates the zone-center phonon dynamics, not anharmonic coupling as previously thought. These findings 
  recontextualize what was thought about the determinants of thermoelectric performance, primarily the role of electron-phonon coupling
  in lowering thermal conductivity.

  I am most grateful to my doctoral advisor Bradley Siwick for his continuing support. Following the trail marked by his questions has led me 
  to be a better scientist. I am also indebted to my fellow research group members who have played a pivotal role in my research: Martin Otto, 
  Mark Stern, Jan-Hendrick Pöhls, Tristan Britt, and Syed Ali Hassan. Other members of the Center of Physics of Materials have also positively 
  influenced my research, most importantly Benjamin Dringoli and Dominique Matte.

  I am also grateful to faculty members Mark Sutton and David Cooke for their advice and support throughout the years.

  The research presented in this dissertation would not have been possible without the support of many McGill employees. I would like to thank Jeannie Mui and S. Kelly Sears 
  from the McGill Facility for Electron Microscopy Research, Richard Rossi and Weihua Wang from the Chemistry department, and Jean-Philippe Guay and 
  John Smeros from the Physics department.

  Finally, I would like to thank the students in our shared office for their friendship and personal support: Dallas Strandell, Gabriela Romero Esquivel, Patrick Brosseau,
